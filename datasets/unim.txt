that crazed girl improvising her music
her poetry dancing upon the shore
her soul in division from itself
climbing falling she knew not where
hiding amid the cargo of a steamship
her knee-cap broken that girl i declare
a beautiful lofty thing or a thing
heroically lost heroically found

no matter what disaster occurred
she stood in desperate music wound
wound wound and she made in her triumph
where the bales and the baskets lay
no common intelligible sound
but sang 'o sea-starved hungry sea

he waits patiently at the gates of heaven
pleased with his sunset-hued tie-dyed robes
she stumbles in rubbing bloodshot eyes behind
her rose colored glasses sure this is another
bad trip or a batch of bad bourbon

jesus smiles grabs his guitar and plays
a couple of familiar riffs crooning take it
take another little piece of my heart now baby

after a flying ovation she realizes
she is not with the kozmic blues band or
big brother and the holding company

you do a lot more talking in your sleep
than you used to do now you're growing old
i wonder what there is for me to keep

look back: you see the path we chose was steep
and needed all our strength  but we were bold
it took our breath and left us only sleep

there was a time when talk of love came cheap
and what was bought was what the other sold
there was so much we didn't think to keep

if all those words were piled up in a heap
of gold like tokens of love bright and cold
would you desire them or ask for sleep

and if we had them back to make us weep
and laugh
yes a laughter uncontrolled
i'd wonder what we'd have that we could keep

i do know this  it's nothing i can hold
last night your words were cries: what was i told
you do a lot of talking in your sleep
i wonder what there is for me to keep

may  i lang hae thought my youthfu' friend
a something to have sent you
tho' it should serve nae ither end
than just a kind memento
but how the subject-theme may gang
let time and chance determine
perhaps it may turn out a sang
perhaps turn out a sermon

ye'll try the world soon my lad
and andrew dear believe me
ye'll find mankind an unco squad
and muckle they may grieve ye
for care and trouble set your thought
ev'n when your end's attained
and a' your views may come to nought
where ev'ry nerve is strained

i'll no say men are villains a
the real harden'd wicked
wha hae nae check but human law
are to a few restricked
but och
mankind are unco weak
an' little to be trusted
if self the wavering balance shake
it's rarely right adjusted

yet they wha fa' in fortune's strife
their fate we shouldna censure
for still th' important end of life
they equally may answer
a man may hae an honest heart
tho' poortith hourly stare him
a man may tak a neibor's part
yet hae nae cash to spare him

aye free aff-han' your story tell
when wi' a bosom crony
but still keep something to yoursel
ye scarcely tell to ony
conceal yoursel' as weel's ye can
frae critical dissection
but keek thro' ev'ry other man
wi' sharpen'd sly inspection

the sacred lowe o' weel-plac'd love
luxuriantly indulge it
but never tempt th' illicit rove
tho' naething should divulge it
i waive the quantum o' the sin
the hazard of concealing
but och
it hardens a' within
and petrifies the feeling

to catch dame fortune's golden smile
assiduous wait upon her
and gather gear by ev'ry wile
that's justified by honour
not for to hide it in a hedge
nor for a train attendant
but for the glorious privilege
of being independent

the fear o' hell's a hangman's whip
to haud the wretch in order
but where ye feel your honour grip
let that aye be your border
its slightest touches instant pause
debar a' side-pretences
and resolutely keep its laws
uncaring consequences

the great creator to revere
must sure become the creature
but still the preaching cant forbear
and ev'n the rigid feature
yet ne'er with wits profane to range
be complaisance extended
an atheist-laugh's a poor exchange
for deity offended

when ranting round in pleasure's ring
religion may be blinded
or if she gie a random sting
it may be little minded
but when on life we're tempest driv'n
a conscience but a canker
a correspondence fix'd wi' heav'n
is sure a noble anchor

adieu dear amiable youth
your heart can ne'er be wanting
may prudence fortitude and truth
erect your brow undaunting
in ploughman phrase god send you speed
still daily to grow wiser
and may ye better reck the rede
then ever did th' adviser

in life every man needs a few things
a reason to get up: the cause
a reason to get started: the adventure
a reason to keep doing: the completion
a reward for the effort: the treat
we lose momentum when these are missing and become still
anything still for a while will spoil and begin to stink

a call to answer
an adventure to live
a beauty to rescue
a dream to persevere
i'm at stage two and in time will see stage to begin
what stage are you

only know you've been high when you're feeling low
disgust the road when you're missing' home
only know you love her when you let her go

t

eliot would've been ashamed of me

i have pointed out the yelling pack
the hare leap to the wood
and when i pass a compliment
rejoice as lover should
at the drooping of an eye
at the mantling of the blood

then suddenly my heart is wrung
by her distracted air
and i remember wildness lost
and after swept from there
am set down standing in the wood
at the death of the hare

because i have loved life i shall have no sorrow to die
i have sent up my gladness on wings to be lost in the blue of the sky
i have run and leaped with the rain i have taken the wind to my breast
my cheeks like a drowsy child to the face of the earth i have pressed
because i have loved life i shall have no sorrow to die

i have kissed young love on the lips i have heard his song to the end
i have struck my hand like a seal in the loyal hand of a friend
i have known the peace of heaven the comfort of work done well
i have longed for death in the darkness and risen alive out of hell
because i have loved life i shall have no sorrow to die
i gave a share of my soul to the world when and where my course is run
i know that another shall finish the task i surely must leave undone
i know that no flower nor flint was in vain on the path i trod
as one looks on a face through a window through life i have looked on god
because i have loved life i shall have no sorrow to die

nor law nor duty bade me fight
nor public men nor cheering crowds
a lonely impulse of delight
drove to this tumult in the clouds
i balanced all brought all to mind
the years to come seemed waste of breath
a waste of breath the years behind
in balance with this life this death

and you-oh you who the wildest yearn
from the old-time step and the glad return
think of her faring on as dear
in the love of there as the love of here
think of her still the same way i say
she is not dead she is just away

yes destiny you have revealed that secret to me
when i first opened my eyes
when the big and clear eyes of the child looked so vivaciously
into the clear big mother's tear

many nights have shrouded the river in silence
oh powerful destiny many unfortunates
have found their black hearse in the river
many dark nights have carried away wonderful souls
on a road of no return
but still i am not losing the hope
that my tired soul shall touch the silver wings
that my angel shall arrive before lonely fraternal eyes
recognize my face in the dark river

at five in the afternoon
it was exactly five in the afternoon
a boy brought the white sheet
at five in the afternoon
a frail of lime ready prepared
at five in the afternoon
the rest was death and death alone

a great man in his pride
confronting murderous men
casts derision upon
supersession of breath
he knows death to the bone
man has created death

there are lone cemeteries
tombs full of soundless bones
the heart threading a tunnel
a dark dark tunnel
like a wreck we die to the very core
as if drowning at the heart
or collapsing inwards from skin to soul

there are corpses
clammy slabs for feet
there is death in the bones
like a pure sound
a bark without its dog
out of certain bells certain tombs
swelling in this humidity like lament or rain

i see when alone at times
coffins under sail
setting out with the pale dead women in their dead braids
bakers as white as angels
thoughtful girls married to notaries
coffins ascending the vertical river of the dead
the wine-dark river to its source
with their sails swollen with the sound of death
filled with the silent noise of death

death is drawn to sound
like a slipper without a foot a suit without its wearer
comes to knock with a ring stoneless and fingerless
comes to shout without a mouth a tongue without a throat
nevertheless its footsteps sound
and its clothes echo hushed like a tree

i do not know i am ignorant i hardly see
but it seems to me that its song has the colour of wet violets
violets well used to the earth
since the face of death is green
and the gaze of death green
with the etched moisture of a violet's leaf
and its grave colour of exasperated winter

but death goes about the earth also riding a broom
lapping the ground in search of the dead
death is in the broom
it is the tongue of death looking for the dead
the needle of death looking for the thread

death lies in our beds
in the lazy mattresses the black blankets
lives a full stretch and then suddenly blows
blows sound unknown filling out the sheets
and there are beds sailing into a harbour
where death is waiting dressed as an admiral

nothing is past nothing is lost
one brief moment and all will be as it was before
how we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again

for certain minutes at the least
that crafty demon and that loud beast
that plague me day and night
ran out of my sight
though i had long perned in the gyre
between my hatred and desire
i saw my freedom won
and all laugh in the sun

now that the loud beast ran
there was no portrait in the gallery
but beckoned to sweet company
for all men's thoughts grew clear
being dear as mine are dear

but soon a tear-drop started up
for aimless joy had made me stop
beside the little lake
to watch a white gull take
a bit of bread thrown up into the air
now gyring down and perning there
he splashed where an absurd
portly green-pated bird
shook off the water from his back
being no more demoniac

yet i am certain as can be
that every natural victory
belongs to beast or demon
that never yet had freeman
right mastery of natural things
and that mere growing old that brings
chilled blood this sweetness brought
yet have no dearer thought
than that i may find out a way
to make it linger half a day

o what a sweetness strayed
through barren thebaid
or by the mareotic sea
when that exultant anthony
and twice a thousand more
starved upon the shore
and withered to a bag of bones
what had the caesars but their thrones

father breath once more farewell
birth you gave was no thing ill
my heart is still as time will tell

your eyes were fixed
staring at nothing and
turning into pale blue

the eyes i ever loved
for being so serene
lovely or lusty
as they change like tides
as they change like seasons

the voice i ever loved
for being so resonant
un-fluttered or breathy
as they greet 'good morning
planting a kiss on my cheek
as they whisper 'good night
planting a kiss on my cheek

those i thought was mine so far
for being so close to my soul
as we ever braided
as the mating snakes
as we never parted
as the sea and the shore

many of them: our beloveds our enemies
came stood and went back
wearing black in the sunny morning
the funeral and mourning get to it's end

some where it says so
when body is slain
soul remain un-slain
he who is never born
is never destructible too
if so let me just forget the things
and let me rejoice the moments
while our souls were together
and then look for the same
again and again

the scene is all too familiar  has this happened before
deja vu on the edge of a waking dream
in another life or maybe all funerals are the same
the same ceremony
the same casket
the same sadness fear and joyousness from everybody that it is nottheir funeral

we are all lined up these familiar strangers
they look like neighbors from past lives
the lady next to me looks likemy st grade teacher
she doesn't seem to know me why would she
didn't i used to deliver newspapers to that man
not in this lifemaybe that was lifetimes ago

the funeral is sad and i cry even though i never knew the boy in the coffini cry because things have to end
why can't they be endless
i cry cause death is heart-breakingi cry for his family's pain

and south or north 'tis only
a choice of friends one knows
and i shall ne'er be lonely
asleep with these or those

and i saw in a vision how far and fleet
that fatal bullet went speeding forth
till it reached a town in the distant north
till it reached a house in a sunny street
till it reached a heart that ceased to beat
without a murmur without a cry
and a bell was tolled in that far-off town
for one who had passed from cross to crown
and the neighbors wondered that she should die

i shall not see the shadows
i shall not fear the rain
i shall not hear the nightingale
sing on as if in pain
and dreaming through the twilight
that doth not rise nor set
haply i may remember
and haply may forget

death is inside the folding cots
it spends its life sleeping on the slow mattresses
in the black blankets and suddenly breathes out
it blows out a mournful sound that swells the sheets
and the beds go sailing toward a port
where death is waiting dressed like an admiral

i am standing upon the seashore
a ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean
she is an object of beauty and strength
i stand and watch until at last she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and the sky come down to mingle with each other
then someone at my side says there she goes

that is all
she is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the place of destination
her diminished size is in me not in her
and just at the moment when someone at my side says there she goes there are other eyes watching her coming and other voices ready to take up the glad shout here she comes

i
under the great comedian's tomb the crowd
a bundle of tempestuous cloud is blown
about the sky where that is clear of cloud
brightness remains a brighter star shoots down
what shudders run through all that animal blood
what is this sacrifice
can someone there
recall the cretan barb that pierced a star

rich foliage that the starlight glittered through
a frenzied crowd and where the branches sprang
a beautiful seated boy a sacred bow
a woman and an arrow on a string
a pierced boy image of a star laid low
that woman the great mother imaging
cut out his heart
some master of design
stamped boy and tree upon sicilian coin

an age is the reversal of an age
when strangers murdered emmet fitzgerald tone
we lived like men that watch a painted stage
what matter for the scene the scene once gone
it had not touched our lives
but popular rage
hysterica passio dragged this quarry down
none shared our guilt nor did we play a part
upon a painted stage when we devoured his heart

come fix upon me that accusing eye
i thirst for accusation
all that was sung
all that was said in ireland is a lie
bred out of the c-ontagion of the throng
saving the rhyme rats hear before they die
leave nothing but the nothings that belong
to this bare soul let all men judge that can
whether it be an animal or a man

ii
the rest i pass one sentence i unsay
had de valera eaten parnell's heart
no loose-lipped demagogue had won the day
no civil rancour torn the land apart

had cosgrave eaten parnell's heart the land's
imagination had been satisfied
or lacking that government in such hands
o'higgins its sole statesman had not died

had even o'duffy but i name no more
their school a crowd his master solitude
through jonathan swift's clark grove he passed and there
plucked bitter wisdom that enriched his blood

he's no more in his chair
he's no more in his bed
i haven't seen him for years
yet i believe he's not dead

we make are families happy when we are born
and make them feel sad when we are gone
life is a gift for us between birth and death
so live every moment your every breath

we were born with a cry
and might end the same i don't know why
whatever we know is the life we spent
so don't waste it ever with your thoughts bent

we are gifted to be in this world
with families and friends whom we hold
good things or mistakes what ever we make
life goes on as ever without a break

there is a reason for our existence
it could even be just showing your presence
life is but feelings what we share
in doing so let's make it fair

life once begun has to end
some day or the other which we can't pretend
families or friends who have left
it is a personal loss while we can't rest

love everyone when they are here
no point in just crying when they have gone for ever
let's give them a grand sendoff even though they can't inspect
so make it a point and pay your last respects

crumbled lives
never to be again
scattered like leaves

say that the men of the old black tower
though they but feed as the goatherd feeds
their money spent their wine gone sour
lack nothing that a soldier needs
that all are oath-bound men
those banners come not in

there in the tomb stand the dead upright
but winds come up from the shore
they shake when the winds roar
old bones upon the mountain shake

those banners come to bribe or threaten
or whisper that a man's a fool
who when his own right king's forgotten
cares what king sets up his rule
if he died long ago
why do you dread us so

there in the tomb drops the faint moonlight
but wind comes up from the shore
they shake when the winds roar
old bones upon the mountain shake

the tower's old cook that must climb and clamber
catching small birds in the dew of the morn
when we hale men lie stretched in slumber
swears that he hears the king's great horn
but he's a lying hound
stand we on guard oath-bound

there in the tomb the dark grows blacker
but wind comes up from the shore
they shake when the winds roar
old bones upon the mountain shake

your my cappuccino
can't live without i know
your my favorite chicken curry
you are so special to me

though nurtured like the sailing moon
in beauty's murderous brood
she walked awhile and blushed awhile
and on my pathway stood
until i thought her body bore
a heart of flesh and blood

but since i laid a hand thereon
and found a heart of stone
i have attempted many things
and not a thing is done
for every hand is lunatic
that travels on the moon

she smiled and that transfigured me
and left me but a lout
maundering here and maundering there
emptier of thought
than the heavenly circuit of its stars
when the moon sails out

cute and hot
mountain and beaches
rose gold and the color of peaches

five languages she knows
lena na usse panga
ycm ke peeche at swarganga

jumping into fire
or walking a thousand mile
would have done anything
for a girl who's a logophile

inside she smiles
outside she cries
then out of nowhere
she shows her love for the fries

saw her in gurudwara
jab milne aaya tha dubara
innocent she was
beautiful for sure
oh god
she's just the girl i am looking for

love not me for comely grace
for my pleasing eye or face
nor for any outward part
no nor for a constant heart
for these may fail or turn to ill
should thou and i sever

keep therefore a true woman's eye
and love me still but know not why
so hast thou the same reason still
to dote upon me ever

'a + b = c' he proclaimed
looking into the eyes of the entire class
i tried to look down to be not enraptured by his eyes
but his eyes mesmerised me

he smiled as if he won my heart
wondered if he heard my heart
gathered all the courage one day to seek his company
in asking few doubts one day

falsely i pointed to sum in text
seriously he began to solve it
couldn't understand a bit
only thing was hit or miss

still holding a pen in his hand
cleared all that was in my mind
murmurring a note of thanks i went
forgetting my book and pen

next day i went to class
hesitant to know that sir's first class
didnt know what to say
when sir gave me in front of class
my book my pen and not my heart

i love my country nigeria
though dwarfed from malaria
because i have an aria
that boils in my heart's rear
which my country must hear
else it flees to rhea

i love my country nigeria
it tilts like the tower of pisa
but stable as the pyramid of giza
easily rocked by a gentle breeze
but stands a storm with ease
the reason for my aria

i love my country nigeria
but wish it were a nation
not a cluster an appellation
of dunes and stretches of savanna
of rocky hills and valleys of banana
of mashes and mire inter alia

i love my country nigeria
not the vultures in peacock's feathers
or the hawks that pride in blathers
who shrill and shrink our coffers
and swagger while the nation suffers
they're soon en route to siberia

i will sing my aria for nigeria
when the dirge sounds with pomp
and we bounce and hop and romp
at the death of our foe corruption
we joy in the birth of our nation
and clasp hands and grow nigeria

i'll live my aria for nigeria
no more aimless amble on an unsure course
excellence's noble mediocrity a curse
beauty wafts from rich garlands of praise
for the legion of merits we raise
a nation truly nigeria

national goals are purpose-driven
so we ponder else we squander
aware we'll soon have to render
in line with god's criteria

but we're both so fuctional
if you put us side by side
it would be so
technological

sit down and take off your shoes
and socks and in fact the rest
of your clothes have a daquiri
turn on some music and dance
around the house inside and out
it's night and the neighbors
are sleeping those dolts and
the stars are shining bright
and i've got the burners lit
for you you hungry thing

you can get drunk on that kind of wine
like the dandelion
so intoxicated with its own insignificance in the greater scheme
of things that it forgets where it cannot grow
and it grows there anyway

the major features of the garden were
in place shrubs and trees: a white flowering
cherry and two thriving wattles
spread their branches in the sunlight

the rotting garden
bare across the winter months
sleeps alive
giving character
bringing in the farm
fecundity in faeces

we talk about consistency of shit
we dig it in
we love it
gives the element of pride
for we are green
and dreaming evermore
of yet another bulging plot

i've a garden a garden of dreams
where the cool breeze whispering sways
softly the apple-sprays
and from leaves that shimmer and quiver
down on mine eyelids streams
a slumber-river

so while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon
half a world
on a trencher
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch
a cup yellow
with miracles
a breast and a nipple

you were born as light
you were born to enlighten
your birth is an incarnation
of infinite knowledge and wisdom

you were born as courageous
you were born to encourage
your resonant voice vibrant words
transformed every sheep being into a lion

your solid self in look
is an ocean of unselfishness in form
your honest and humble heart
is full of desire less love for mankind

your extraordinary thought process
unified both science and spirituality
all our foolishness is washed out
with the flush of your enormous wisdom

your unflinching affection on the nation
lifted the land's glory to the heights of heaven
your boundless concern on fellowmen
beautified the brotherhood among our brethren

within your husks
like gentle kernels
our sober provincial
children's hearts were nurtured
until life began
to shuck us from the ear

thus ends
in peace
this career
of the armed vegetable
which is called an artichoke
then
scale by scale
we strip off
the delicacy
and eat

oranges
do not grow in the sea
neither is there love in sevilla
you in dark and the i the sun that's hot
loan me your parasol

i'll wear my jealous reflection
juice of lemon and lime
and your words
your sinful little words
will swim around awhile

oranges
do not grow in the sea
ay love
and there is no love in sevilla

no ordered flock but schools of comets
spinning tails of flame
arsonists
lighting the sodden woodlands
and the greenwood of myself halfway
through an august afternoon

they did not stay to fan the fire
so i sprouted wings of words and joined them
keen to learn what flying means
not dragging wings through air as geese do
pumping steady over oceans nor like egrets
snow-white flappers floating on the sky's
black river and nothing like the owl
i saw today slide deathly mute
through mazy pines

these masters lack what swallows
effortlessly effuse: not skill nor grace
but thrill and simmer
flying exclamation points
darting from no place to no place fast
banking and swerving like dervishes like
shards of light bouncing on the trampoline
of air
as if flight were not a flapping habit
but a dizzy calling less a way of moving

the jester walked in the garden
the garden had fallen still
he bade his soul rise upward
and stand on her window-sill

it rose in a straight blue garment
when owls began to call
it had grown wise-tongued by thinking
of a quiet and light footfall
but the young queen would not listen
she rose in her pale night-gown
she drew in the heavy casement
and pushed the latches down

he bade his heart go to her
when the owls called out no more
in a red and quivering garment
it sang to her through the door

it had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming
of a flutter of flower-like hair
but she took up her fan from the table
and waved it off on the air

'i have cap and bells ' he pondered
'i will send them to her and die
and when the morning whitened
he left them where she went by

she laid them upon her bosom
under a cloud of her hair
and her red lips sang them a love-song
till stars grew out of the air

she opened her door and her window
and the heart and the soul came through
to her right hand came the red one
to her left hand came the blue

they set up a noise like crickets
a chattering wise and sweet
and her hair was a folded flower
and the quiet of love in her feet

the ordered curly and plain cabbages
are all set out like school-children in rows
in six short weeks shall these no longer please
for with that ink-proud lady the rose pleasure goes
i cannot think what moved the poet men
so to write panegyrics of that foolish
simpleton - while wild-rose as fresh again
lives and the drowsed cabbages keep soil coolish

tip-cuttings
were dipped into hormones
then trays of sphagnum
where captured seed
from pollinated azalea pods
was scattered
to grow inside the glasshouse

the tiny plants
were transferred to tubes
then bigger pots
until the glasshouse filled
and expanded
prolifically growing
bulging
under mist sprays
creating heat and humidity
as an amorphously pregnant

pots on benches
on top of pots
verdant and fecund
almost promiscuous
smelling of soil
sweat and fertilizer

weeds entangled
trying to take over and strangle
until removed
and ignominiously tossed
into the compost bin

o soft and dainty maiden from afar
i watch you as amidst the flowers you move
and pluck them singing

more golden than all gold your tresses are
never was harp-note like your voice my love
your voice sweet-ringing

they have been whispering in my ears
besides my heart doth presume
as thou art my life's pearl

i could write you a poem
i could write you a song
so it says my heart
i could but i won't

numbers on napkins
surprised at my advance and
trip on my reactions
get what you dish out

locked up in passion
never make a promise
but i'll be what he

tell you in person and close it in captions
back up my words with consistent actions
look in your eyes and ignore all distractions
a counter point

intently
tempt me
threaten me
i'll

not
i'm harsh but effective like
bourbon on the rocks
i'm

learning on a curve
and im certain they couldn't stop
the pace in case you doubted

because there is safety in derision
i talked about an apparition
i took no trouble to convince
or seem plausible to a man of sense
distrustful of thar popular eye
whether it be bold or sly
fifteen apparitions have i seen
the worst a coat upon a coat-hanger

i have found nothing half so good
as my long-planned half solitude
where i can sit up half the night
with some friend that has the wit
not to allow his looks to tell
when i am unintelligible
fifteen apparitions have i seen
the worst a coat upon a coat-hanger

when a man grows old his joy
grows more deep day after day
his empty heart is full at length
but he has need of all that strength
because of the increasing night
that opens her mystery and fright
fifteen apparitions have i seen
the worst a coat upon a coat-hanger

drink it
and remember in every
drop of gold
in every topaz glass
in every purple ladle
that autumn labored
to fill the vessel with wine
and in the ritual of his office
let the simple man remember
to think of the soil and of his duty

we were three weeks
into term sheila
when you came
through the classroom door
forty-four children
bent over books
copying roethke's

i taught you greek
but your painting of
was pure platonic form

you drew the masks
of comedy and tragedy
in perfect harmony

the river runs swift with a song breaking through all
barriers
but the mountain stays and remembers and follows her
with his love

together we behold the joy and the feel
makes my body and wounded soul heal
let my spirit console
on my angel's lap
and be a precious gift
that fills its wounded gap

there are bad and good things around
just try to look from side-to-side
then you'll see the naked ground
which separate the wrong from the right one

wow
nothing is sweeter
beyond these sweet words exists a life
one granted when my lips touched them

white light
a white light
wakened in the waters of my soul
over the wings of a flying bird
just as once before

white hope
a voice of life colors without borders
an open canvas of colors brighten
beautiful
just as dreams of nights of no return
thunderstorm
of a burning star steaming hot

white word
raised in the high benches of thoughts
carved in ancient mythology of trust
poured
in fiery horizons of the west

white life
a broken mirror of crossed fates
a deep sea of kidnapped sorrows
just as snow

of course i love you
but if you love me
marry a young woman

i couldn't stand it
to live with a young
man i being older

better not try
to impress
with your sorrows
life has too few hollows
to be empty

your promises are leaves
in a forest deciduous
fertile in fall
otherwise green

if memories were governed
by demand and supply
market forces i mean
all geniuses could be ordinary
all histories linear
since they are not
meanings can be metaphors

oh
descendant of heavenly fraternity
i wait at the line
for i am yours for eternity

golden hair paling the glowing sun
eyes of sapphire or a slice of ocean
smile that kill
stare that make time stand still
giggles take the breath away
curls make a cascade shy
curves like a drifting rain
girl for sure is from ukraine

it was a coincidence that you were from same college as well
i have watched your dance
each and every moves reflects the dance of goddess

here at right of the entrance this bronze head
human superhuman a bird's round eye
everything else withered and mummy-dead
what great tomb-haunter sweeps the distant sky
and finds there nothing to make its tetror less
hysterica passio of its own emptiness

no dark tomb-haunter once her form all full
as though with magnanimity of light
yet a most gentle woman who can tell
which of her forms has shown her substance right
or maybe substance can be composite
profound mctaggart thought so and in a breath
a mouthful held the extreme of life and death

or else i thought her supernatural
as though a sterner eye looked through her eye
on this foul world in its decline and fall
on gangling stocks grown great great stocks run dry
ancestral pearls all pitched into a sty
heroic reverie mocked by clown and knave
and wondered what was left for massacre to save

just dip one finger
then you shall know
what it is to seethe
in an acid throw

everything shall change
the day you're in my place
when someone throws acid
on your body and face

you'll burn you'll run
you'll shriek and scream
when the mirror reflects
your shattered dream

when your hair shall singe
your skull lose shape
your ears scrunch up
your blisters painfully gape

when your sparkling sight
shall be blind to light
when all your days turn
into an unending night

when your mouth won't open
for a morsel or drink
when your nose chin neck
crinkle and shrink

when sleep shall evade
your eyelids won't blink
your mind shall cramp
you'll not be able to think

when it shall be tough
to take normal respiration
when the skin shall be
speckled by depigmentation

when every ogle shall
self-consciousness increase
when self-esteem shall lower
and confidence decrease

when the cinematic past
shall now and then unfold
when a chill from top to bottom
scurry unbearably cold

when the scarred soul shall
the veins and nerves harden
when the mind shall waver
between revenge and pardon

when loved ones shall begin
to criticize and victimize
when society shall distance
shun and ostracize

when each passing second
shall make your heart sink
you'll cry groan ask
why this acid splash in a wink

it's then yes then when
pain shall call sorrow
the two of these shall peer
into a prospectless morrow

but nay let the inner turmoil
buoy up the iceberg of courage
get-up acid girls
it's a war you have to wage
you have to wage
yes you have to wage

what's a book compared to you
little girl
there's no story half so true
little girl
come now clamber on my knee
you bring more of love to me
than my whole great library
little girl

yes i came in here to read
little girl
but a book i do not need
little girl
all the printed line could tell
you impart with magic spell
love and laughter with you dwell
little girl

i would be a churlish dad
little girl
if for you no time i had
little girl
clamber on my knee tonight
you can give me more delight
than the books that great men write
little girl

you 're a volume full of love
little girl published up in heaven above
little girl
every word of yours rings true
sweet the little deeds you do
i shall never tire of you
little girl

i
like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough
a-top on the topmost twig which the pluckers forgot somehow
forget it not nay but got it not for none could get it till now

which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound
until the purple blossom is trodden in the ground

way down south in dixie
they hung my black young lover
to a cross roads tree

way down south in dixie
i asked the white lord jesus
what was the use of prayer

way down south in dixie
love is a naked shadow
on a gnarled and naked tree

oh god
please listen to me
my body is tired my mind is gone
my faith is withering away
i can't understand the bible anymore
the devil's in my ear telling me to kill my neighbor
black crows rest and converse with me on my lawn

look i need your help
i stopped praying six months ago
my job is gone my wife left me
and my house is soon to be foreclosed

my life is crumbling away like a house infested with termites
when i go to the beach the shore runs away from me
the sand sets my feet on fire
oh lord listen to me

my problems don't end there
you see last night i contemplated suicide
i put rat poison in my own food
just couldn't bring myself to eat it

wait- what lord
why don't you sound mat at me
why are you talking to me so calmly
oh lord i love you

i thought that i would be such a disgrace to you
that you would no longer claim me as your son
what did i do wrong lord
why is my life such a miserable wreck
what
what do you mean i forgot the most important part
what is it

what do you mean because i stopped praying my life took a turn to hell
oh i see
i should have not stopped praying
but lord times were getting so tough that i thought you weren't listening
so i stopped

what
but what do you mean
you were working with me
a test to see how strong i was

oh my god please don't tell me i failed
please lord just give me another chance
i promise i won't let you down

then god said
my son you didn't fail
you see your life was at its very end
you knew you couldn't carry on by yourself
you came to me during you darkest time
in your spiritual journey
my son you passed

then the man woke up
and his wife was smiling as bright as the sun
and said
let's pray together

from the start o lord god
you held me close when i was lost
and believed in me beyond
a shadow of a doubt

i knew from the beginning
my life was a wonderful blessing
i wasn't supposed to ask you why
but you helped me to live
my life every day

o lord god the most powerful
thank you for everything and for all
the things that are bright and beautiful
i love you from the deepest of my heart
and i promise my love for you
will never be apart

the paintbrush broken and gone
the artwork had an owner in town
oh dear
what a tragedy to behold
we will keep it until we are old

the beau found a beautiful wife
the belle started a new life
how painful
they drifted apart
woe to their forgotten one heart

i believe forever isn't true
you don't have enough time i tell you
treasure every moment that you have my love
you would never know when to lose your beloved

'god i want a sign
within the next ten minutes
said my friend
loking at her watch
'go
we sat and waited

it happened in an instant like a flash of light
a burning deep within me like a shooting star or a crashing flight
like icarus before his demise

it felt as natural as soil between toes
the first time our souls met
she took my breath away with every word she spoke and when she held me close
like a corset
even the small things        she did with divinity
she spoke like a waltz
enhancing my affinity
goddess among women      rose among the weeds       you are effortlessly without fault

there must be something in the waters
passed down to the mediterranean's daughters
my amphitrite my goddess of sea
who swam through my veins like cocaine

goddesses only exist in the heart and in myths
i learned once again
it's proved more difficult than i'd imagined
trying to stay sane
you got under my skin          like a tattoo
you spread quickly as a rumour
mysterious magnificent
and malignant as a tumour

who invented natural medicine
cures remedies to combat ill health
eliminate suffering and pain
to make the weak strong again
only on one place earth
apollo the god of healing

she sneezed then muttered 'thank you
though no one had said anything
except god
the giver of sneezes

blue the color of my eyelids
escort me to space
intangible indefinite bits
i stare closed eyes in daze

full of faith and belief
i prayed and prayed
and at long last god
said to me
i'm moved by your faith
is there something you'd like

and god smiled
and said
would you like
some gold oil and money

a never-ending supply
of food perhaps
asked god

no no never that
what you want to ruin me
i said
and prayed and prayed

wealth
fame
a good obedient wife
who can't speak perhaps
said good god

no no
i said
and prayed and prayed

shall i offered god
remove all suffering
from the world

no i said
the world's already used to it
and i prayed and prayed

look you must tell me
what you want
said god now appearing a little irritated

oh well if you insist
i said
i want your job

what made the ceiling waterproof
landor's tarpaulin on the roof
what brushes fly and moth aside
irving and his plume of pride

for my heart has ached with the pain
of separation from you
my lips have
spoken words that have caused others
to be in turmoil

for only in the gospel will my answers be
through the christ the redeemer my
redemption from this life of multiple lies

for both scripture and tradition tell
me this is how he exists
our common
lord who will wash clean the heart

in spiritu humilitatis et in animo
contrito suscipiamur a te domine
et sic fiat sacrificium nostrum in
conspectu tuo hodie ut placeat
tibi domine deus

let everything within me live up
to the words i pray
may every
promise to you good lord be
everything to me

for only in the father
only in the son
only in the holy spirit
is found the truth i have so
deeply been trying to reclaim

that lover of a night
came when he would
went in the dawning light
whether i would or no
men come men go
all things remain in god

banners choke the sky
men-at-arms tread
armoured horses neigh
in the narrow pass
all things remain in god

before their eyes a house
that from childhood stood
uninhabited ruinous
suddenly lit up
from door to top
all things remain in god

i had wild jack for a lover
though like a road
that men pass over
my body makes no moan
but sings on
all things remain in god

dust has settled
but o
sun i have been recalled
the darkest nights has said informidable
the silent chirps are now
in deepened furrows of earth with no dreams
eclipsing
i have heard no tale
and of ancient seers and lords too
a heart like you melt at my doorsteps

i yet know of no melody
but in pain to sing a song
the prevailing destinies who say no lord
and in no order to mimic
there is no resolution
i glance at bleakest hope
should i become a saviour
or wait till your warmth a fresh aroma
fills my senses

a group of drunks
all longing to connect
who pray some
higher force will intercede
to heal the wounds
of strife abuse neglect
create a power
out of human need

i was four years old
when i didn't believe in god
i thought god was not true
but he helped me when i felt blue

in my dream i saw the lord jesus christ
he told me he died for us
for the forgiveness of our sins
and for the fulfillment of the new testament

when i woke up that night
i cried so hard
now i truly understand
and i won't let jesus out of my sight

i know there are things that are hard
for someone like me to comprehend
yet i never lose my hope and faith
because god is my food of strength

today i promise myself to be good
and spread the words of our lord god
even in my own little ways
i'll serve him all my remaining days

he whom you perpetually kept close to your chest was not god
and he who made every single heart throb for the person it loved was not one of god's infinite disciples but god himself
he whom you witnessed blossoming was not god
and he who stood taller than the sun to illuminate every miserably darkened cranny of trembling soil was not one of god's infinite disciples but god himself

god opens doors of opportunity that
no one can close
do not be upset
when you encounter troubles
good things will happen in our lives

leave all deadly sins behind
including jealousy and hatred
be faithful to him and
do the righteous ways

even though someone
put your life in danger and in sorrows
be happy each day and
learn how to forgive

he knows our desires before
we even know them
learn how to appreciate
his almighty blessings

indeed we will be able to thank him
with all our hearts and
with all our souls as
he works in a mysterious ways

therefore god only knows what
no one can predict
be thankful each day and
live happily

how seldom do we talk to god enquire his plan
why waste moments in planning the future
when all to be done is bow our head

yup you're not here for me
and i concede i'll never have
the pieces that you need

the ship boards creak
the rigging sings
and down my cheeks stream mist and spray
my breath grows fast
my knees feel weak
as fate speeds me away

her eyes her lips become her face
the white form i just held a glow
the town recedes
the sky looms vast
as ranks of white-caps grow

what once was green now fades to blue
above the shifting rows of gray
my heels lift up
the hilltops sink
i'm bound away away

before i leave the stage
i will sing the only song
i was meant truly to sing

it is the song
of i am
yes: i am me
amp
you
we are

i love us with every drop
of our blood
every atom of our cells
our waving particles
-undaunted flags of our being
neither here nor there

a voice in the morning
calling from far away
a muezzin
and the night
drawing all its weapons
to the hoard
the sun
painting the east in red
and i
sleeping on my bed

today i wonder
more about your taste
i wonder
when and how you'll find out
what an ass he is

i wonder why
and with such haste
you gaily shovel up
his stinking waste

all life  to know each other
whom we can never learn
and bye and bye  a change
called heaven
rapt neighborhoods of men
just finding out  what puzzled us
without the lexicon

i think i can sing an elegy for you now
or maybe write a beautiful story of your broken vow
because i have thoughts and this feeling
that i can't hide because i'm drowning

do i have the right to be this way
to think of you almost everyday
when i know we came to our end
when i can't even remain as a friend

i can't stop crying for you and for us
letting you go is just the worse
i hope one night a shooting star passes by
so i could wish to move on and bid goodbye

or maybe i could wish for my tears to be frozen
because i know i won't see you comin
to save me from this marvelous madness
our love that turned into a ravishing sadness

excited jubilant
in joyous bliss
he came to me
i felt excitement swell
enthused yet scared
i'm longed so for his kiss

but what i heard from you
sounds vague
do tell
i want to change your life
yes i want change

yet when he's close me
i can't get near
though flattered by his focus
something's strange

he could've had my heart
but if i did
he'd bury me
beneath his pyramid

i live my lie
'cause if the theory's true
love damned can't die

if you'll say goodbye
because you're tired enough to stay
i thank you for the moments we had
and the chance to think of you each day

if you'll say goodbye
because you want to see a different view
i thank you for giving me your eyes
and the opportunity to see only you

if you'll say goodbye
because another love awaits out there
i thank you for telling me once
that you love me and you'll never find another

if you'll say goodbye
because you want to save your being
i thank you for the time you gave me
that to you my presence was worth something

if you'll say goodbye
because change hit you hard
thank you for keeping me long enough
i love you and you'll always be in my heart

ii
yet spade reminded me of angel unloading a bus
dressed in blue overalls black face official angel's work
man cap
pushing with his belly a huge tin horse piled high with
black baggage
looking up as he passed the yellow light bulb of the loft
and holding high on his arm an iron shepherd's crook

one last package sits lone at midnight sticking up out
of the coast rack high as the dusty fluorescent
light

the wage they pay us is too low to live on
tragedy
reduced to numbers
this for the poor shepherds
i am a communist
farewell ye greyhound where i suffered so much
hurt my knee and scraped my hand and built
my pectoral muscles big as a vagina

i know your presence is just in memories
i see you in skies smiles are watery then
feel in cosy wonder and wish
that i could feel your presence once again

let my hand touch yours
let me warm it if it's cold
my last warmth shall not be wasted

august nd  venice
i carry within myself the remnants- the abrupt pause of an unfinished conversation and while speaking to myself those utterances of a breath and pause may be overheard as one may overhear the words and watch the gestures of a boatman or gondolier leaning toward his passengers-convincing them of his skills in exchange for the correct amount of sequins
of his skills in ferrying them across the grand canal
then without a second thought the conversation and the rapid arm movements cease and that tired look from the tourist evaporates and the message of safety across water is conveyed
many boatman have spoken to me of their efforts to convince tourists who travel from the roads of padova and bologna to leap from the stone embankment and throw down their small cases to them

november th   venice
i an walking toward a bare wall
my fingertip is tracing
perfectly the exact place
where many subjects meet
they are given life only
by gravity extending
through the fading patterns
of sunlight

until finally i discover
they have eliminated all
my pencilled outlines

how will i describe to you that simple
movement of a hand toward a wall
would you recognise the succession of images
that appear as i stand within this room

or should i describe
that movement of a hand that falls the palazzo pesaro
and in the distance the campanile san marcuola
rezzonico sagrado and many other views that pause
at the window waiting quietly for me to invite them inside
this room as one does with old friends - the lightness of a smile on my lips a hand poised
for greetings

that bite left on my neck
will cease to smart
but what about
the hickey on my heart

no matter how mistreated
tricked or scarred
right now
it's all 'bout you
and keeping hard

it's not in the best interest
of a germ like hiv or you
to kill its host

she might so noble from head
to great shapely knees
the long flowing line
have walked to the altar
through the holy images
at pallas athene's side
or been fit spoil for a centaur
drunk with the unmixed wine

however they may take it
before the thread began
i made and may not break it
when the last thread has run
a bargain with that hair
and all the windings there

it`s not the end of the road
it`s the beginning of a new highway
the `highway to a destination called `success

'those platonists are a curse ' he said
'god's fire upon the wane
a diagram hung there instead
more women born than men

and took their tablets and did sums
i would be ignorant as the dawn
that merely stood rocking the glittering coach
above the cloudy shoulders of the horses
i would be  for no knowledge is worth a straw
ignorant and wanton as the dawn

the character there on a hollywood
plateau ok he looks a lot like me
ok he expresses his momentary joy
he hasn't had to rehearse his role

he has his real face for a mask
no stage-fright
no trouble
still
says he i enjoy myself like a jack
i play the part bet ten to one

a black boy ten to twelve years old
and i terrify people in silence
without the smallest knife in my hand
women see themselves already ravished

i've taken on his features to survive
and from me to the kid spotlights
have furnished only wastelands

i would find by the edge of that water
the collar-bone of a hare
worn thin by the lapping of water
and pierce it through with a gimlet and stare
at the old bitter world where they marry in churches
and laugh over the untroubled water
at all who marry in churches
through the white thin bone of a hare

i have old women's secrets now
that had those of the young
madge tells me what i dared not think
when my blood was strong
and what had drowned a lover once
sounds like an old song

how such a man pleased women most
of all that are gone
how such a pair loved many years
and such a pair but one
stories of the bed of straw
or the bed of down

picture and book remain
an acre of green grass
for air and exercise
now strength of body goes
midnight an old house
where nothing stirs but a mouse

my temptation is quiet
here at life's end
neither loose imagination
nor the mill of the mind
consuming its rag and bonc
can make the truth known

a mind michael angelo knew
that can pierce the clouds
or inspired by frenzy
shake the dead in their shrouds
forgotten else by mankind
an old man's eagle mind

processions that lack high stilts have nothing that
catches the eye
what if my great-granddad had a pair that were
twenty foot high
and mine were but fifteen foot no modern stalks
upon higher
some rogue of the world stole them to patch up a fence
or a fire

because piebald ponies led bears caged lions ake
but poor shows
because children demand daddy-long-legs upon this
timber toes
because women in the upper storeys demand a face at
the pane
that patching old heels they may shriek i take to
chisel and plane

all metaphor malachi stilts and all
a barnacle goose
far up in the stretches of night night splits and the
dawn breaks loose
i through the terrible novelty of light stalk on stalk on
those great sea-horses bare their teeth and laugh at the dawn

thunder in the darkness painted my room green
i woke up with tears in my eyes
i couldn't stop crying even i realized it was just a dream
and my grandfather never had a dog in his life

i
that is no country for old men
the young
in one another's arms birds in the trees
- those dying generations at their song
the salmon-falls the mackerel-crowded seas
fish flesh or fowl commend all summer long
whatever is begotten born and dies
caught in that sensual music all neglect
monuments of unageing intellect

ii
an aged man is but a paltry thing
a tattered coat upon a stick unless
soul clap its hands and sing and louder sing
for every tatter in its mortal dress
nor is there singing school but studying
monuments of its own magnificence
and therefore i have sailed the seas and come
to the holy city of byzantium

iii
o sages standing in god's holy fire
as in the gold mosaic of a wall
come from the holy fire perne in a gyre
and be the singing-masters of my soul
consume my heart away sick with desire
and fastened to a dying animal
it knows not what it is and gather me
into the artifice of eternity

iv
once out of nature i shall never take
my bodily form from any natural thing
but such a form as grecian goldsmiths make
of hammered gold and gold enamelling
to keep a drowsy emperor awake
or set upon a golden bough to sing
to lords and ladies of byzantium
of what is past or passing or to come

i bade because the wick and oil are spent
and frozen are the channels of the blood
my discontented heart to draw content
from beauty that is cast out of a mould
in bronze or that in dazzling marble appears
appears but when wc have gone is gone again
being more indifferent to our solitude
than 'twere an apparition
o heart we are old
the living beauty is for younger men

raking the leaves raking the lives
raking life and leaf together
the old men smell of burning leaves
but which is which they wonder amp mdash whether
anyone tells the leaves and loves amp mdash
anyone left that is who lives

it's a little bit sad when you seem very near
to adventures and things of that sort
which nearly begin and then don't and you know
it is only because you are short

the seventh
they walked the roads
mimicking what they heard as children mimic
they understood that wisdom comes of beggary

there was an old man of thermopyl
who never did anything properly
but they said if you choose to boil eggs in your shoes
you shall never remain in thermopyl

of golden king and silver lady
bellowing up and bellowing round
till toes mastered a sweet measure
mouth mastered a sweet sound
prancing round and prancing up
until they pranced upon the top

that golden king and that wild lady
sang till stars began to fade
hands gripped in hands toes close together
hair spread on the wind they made
that lady and that golden king
could like a brace of blackbirds sing

'it's certain that my luck is broken
that rambling jailbird billy said
'before nightfall i'll pick a pocket
and snug it in a feather bed
i cannot find the peace of home
on great-grandfather's battered tomb

and bending down beside the glowing bars
murmur a little sadly how love fled
and paced upon the mountains overhead
and hid his face amid a crowd of stars

young men know nothing of this sort
observant old men know it well
and when they know what old books tell
and that no better can be had
know why an old man should be mad

a door
a stair
and two steps inside that dark
the straight-backed chair my grandmother sat in
a lace net draped across its mahogany arm
and on the table a volume of stories
open at the flyleaf its tissue quill-scarred

the photographs seal her in a shell of relations
the sepia corset would have her no more
than an empress delegating domestic chores
in this room imagine her gravely accepting
tributes of porcelain and sparkling brass
or setting tiger lilies afloat in bowls or stocking
pots of pickled mango in the attic of summer

she had to whet the brusque words of command
on waspish crones in the inner courtyard
had to tame the peacocks in the garden
and dry the raisins of tact with aunts-in-law
invalids who ruled from brass-bound chests
and serene beds of illness

she grew up with her children kept house
in a city of merchant ships and parade-ground strife
made a home in the rain-gashed heart
of that world in whose lanes stowaway chinese sang
the praises of their silk and coolies peddled
cartloads of spices plucked for colder ports
like the poets of that city she wrote in two languages
spoke a third in polite company the lines enjambed
over the trellises the words trapped in porous stone

she died giving birth to a daughter
on armistice day
she grew into the earth then a storied fig tree
whose roots shot to heaven and branches burrowed
so deep they seeded a forest

giving consumed grandmother
connected to her
by nothing more substantial than a spiralled thread
of protein i wake some nights to find her eyes
staring at me from the mirror
grandmother when she died younger than i am now
cut in half by the streetlight's glare

hoard your powers she says do not give
from the core my son do not give
giving spites the flesh corrodes intention
most unreliable of barters most memorable of sins
giving kills
my son do not like karna
rip off the armour that is your skin

these feet have worked farmland
drawing wheat grains from sand grains
and now they walk to the supermarket each week

these feet have walked thorugh the pages of a history book
these feet have walked along the spine of time itself
these feet
will one day be mine
and yours
when we are old
and wrinkles arrive

although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face
and even old men's eyes grew dim this hand alone
like some last courtier at a gypsy camping-place
babbling of fallen majesty records what's gone

these lineaments a heart that laughter has made sweet
these these remain but i record what's gone
a crowd
will gather and not know it walks the very street
whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud

hold the door open for everyone
and we all emerge on the sales floor
and lose ourselves in the great common ground
of housewares on markdown

georgia desmarais taps each wall to check for a weak spot
a clue like rodin first reading dante then baudelaire
is today wednesday or thursday
where are the light switches
georgia is growing wary her eye like max ernst's chinese nightingale its iron beak as cold to the touch
no warmth
no barrateen bedding
no food water or electricity
just colored lines and sometimes a mansard roof
wenge door at the back sealed shut

soft like cotton candy
caring like mother earth
beautiful like a piece of art
sweet like honey
deep like faith
that was my grandmother's heart

this is what i remember
running into your sitting room
holding up an offering of snails
and pepper ''from the bush
and announcing to the gathered guests that we would have
for dinner peppery snail soup

i remember my incomprehension at the sudden laughter
that burst out like it was planned my heartbeat quickening faster now
i remember i wanted to cry

you called me grandma
you were laughing too
only not at me but with me at them
i remember your beautiful smell: something fragile and something good
as holding me close you said
''of course we'd have the soup
it was some time before i found out
my pepper ''bush'' was your pepper farm
that those snails were the tiny ejula
the ones that aren't eaten

this memory
of a girl barely seven holding her silver- haired grandma
as the laughter died
is what this girl has cooked and stirred kept stored up
when everything else seemed bleak
because you taught me it doesn't matter how many mistakes i make
it matters that i seek

reine wasn't chubby
but she must have been strong-willed
to survive
alone with two young children
even though to me
she always spoke in a soft voice
just as i speak to avia
never forgetting i am the link
between yesterday and tomorrow

i am sory elisha
i didn't really think supa strikas was frightening
i was bored
watching the adventures of the super-football players
as if winning a match
was the most important thing in the world
i tried to share your enthusiasm
oh the baddies have caught the hero
where are they taking him
how scary

you froze
you shuddered and said you didn't want to watch any more
well neither did i
but i am sorry i frightened you
i didn't mean to spoil your pleasure
after all
what do grandmothers know about football

i rise in the dawn and i kneel and blow
till the seed of the fire flicker and glow
and then i must scrub and bake and sweep
till stars are beginning to blink and peep
and the young lie long and dream in their bed
of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head
and their day goes over in idleness
and they sigh if the wind but lift a tress
while i must work because i am old
and the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold

crawl in my arms and rest your head
my love i will not lie to you
we both know we might soon be dead
beneath my chin love tuck your head
there's nothing we can do instead
and every day bring sorrows new
above my heart now rest your head
you know i cannot lie to you

when you awake i won't be here
when i return you might not wake
but till you're fast asleep my love
i'll hold you for love's sake

my love there's nothing we can do
so why not get a little sleep
my love i cannot lie to you
there just is nothing we can do
but tears and hugs can help it's true
so feel my arms my love and weep
you know there's nothing we can do
let's try to get a little sleep

you're frightened weary from the pain
if you feel pain you're still alive
let's hope when dead it won't remain
i know you're desperate from the pain
and wine tonight would numb the brain
but numb our love as well
so strive
to feel my love and feel the pain
so we will know we're still alive

the sea is deep
the sea is vast
the winds they die
the winds they blast

does he think of the sheets on the clothes-lines
as he darts mid the rigging and sails
does his ship rock him calm like the cradle
is his soup on his chin in a gale
there'll be no sleep tonight
oh where sleeps my laddie tonight

in the tub he was always in soap swells
in my womb he would bound all night long
does he kick when he's dreaming of neptune
or does neptune now join him in song

can sirens sing lullaby laddie
on the mast in the squall will he hear me
when in tears to the waves my heart screams
oh where sleeps my boy tonight
oh where lies my laddie tonight

to the impeccable poet
to the perfect magician of french letters
to the very dear
and very venerated master and friend

make this stationary but it is already weighed moresca motion
four cruel columns twisting into beams and arches an epigraph
an old rending red wailing still wailing today an altered chord

i missed you a lot
when you left me
your memory took away
my adored liberty

your speechless portrait
spoke to me
of the days gone by
the days of felicity

i extended my hand
you did not hold
yet at times i felt your touch
a touch that was cold

you called me across the meadow
across the rippling stream
i saw you in and out of me
i saw you in my dream

each day in sequence
passed into the past
and vultures of remembrance
pecked the dead 'me

only wings fluttered
in the blue nullity
your memory took away
my adored liberty

pleure lili lili
pleure lili baby
puisqu'il va disparaitre

pleure lili lili
le suivre c'est mourir
mais rester c'est maudire
l'encore et l'infini

je sais lili baby
cette indicible peine
oui mais lili tu suis
a la neige en hiver
a tes larmes impies

pleure lili lili
laisse l'ange endormi
choir sans heurt et sans bruit

pleure lili baby
et que rien ne te freine
car tu meurs aujourd'hui
a mesure que s'oublient
vos promesses assoupies

tu sais lili ses ailes
interdit
tu ne voleras plus avec lui

all pleasure is of this condition
it pricks men forward to fruition
but if enjoy'd then like the humming bee
the honey being shed away doth flee
but leaves a sting that wounds the inward heart
with gnawing grief and never-ending smart

she is not gone amidst the dry leaves
she is not gone amidst the green trees
she was never here to fight or stay
she was always here to live and play

i have locked myself in here
why don't i go out there
don't i hold my freedom dear

so i sneak out clandestinely
to make my first move towards my family
but what i see is the absence of love compassion warmth and humility

the rich want a catch
the poor want to snatch
women complain of being exploited
men retort as being targeted
there's a need for these jargons to be deconstructed

i found out my way through somehow
and came across a blood-soaked dove
she said this is the worth of peace my love

strangulated i return back to my prison
because i find no reason
to live freely in a world full of treason

on my journey ahead
for more frightening will face me: the thought filled me with dread
though my hunger for knowledge

i'm held here in suspension
so i patiently waited hoping he would relent
but time just marched on with opportunities spent
as my life drifted on and the years passed me by
all that remained

to enquire of this gate
though i was informed it was just for my fate
and thus when i am gone it will be closed up and locked
i've no time to be sorry nor time to be shocked
i think of all those ambitions of those things i've desired
for the unique opportunities

i am shocked i am sad
at the animals
on aggression and brutality
humanity is crying
at the abnormality and animality
hands behind the killings
by the blood of innocent children
are coloured
and the heart of the enemies
is satisfied

you give me an apartment full of morning smells toasted bagel and black
coffee and the freckled lilies in the vase on the windowsill
you give me -across

you give me the first bird of morning alighting on a wire
with their feet on the chairs
you give me the swoop of homemade kites in the park on sunday
you give me afternoon-colored beer with lemons in it

you give me d
h
lawrence
and he gives me pomegranates and sorb-apples

you give me midnight apples in a car with the windows down
you give me the flashbulbs of an electrical storm
you give me thunder and the suddenly green underbellies of clouds

you give me hyacinths and narcissus
you give me foxgloves
and soft fists of peony

yet there are times
i find the slightest strain
can zap and twist my soul
in wrenching pain

the song of earth has many different chords
ocean has many moods and many tones
yet always ocean
in the damp spring woods
the painted trillium smiles while crisp pine cones
autumn alone can ripen
so is this
one music with a thousand cadences

let it bow to weep
and speak bitterness in words
let tears roll in my heart to produce ink of sorrow
o
the sun that should wipe our tears
has faded with a rare hero
death has come
madiba is gone
to the santuary of holy's
to return no more

farewell
to
- nelson mandela

for with words
words of heart
words of thought
words of
pain
rejoice
benevolence
mends thy heart
from a shatter of a forever break
a break

misuse decay's from inside
scripture beats on lies of crimes in an early sunshine
empty life leaves scratch the willow sallow
warning day o' coming washes man's sins forgiven
luke warm sadness punctuates inert organs of pain
haunt of madness catches so slow below us
none seen -none heard a creature hides behind
battle bow of bones in time all life folds above us sweet exodus

i am dead
for myself
and for you also
if i am alive
only for the world
that
continues to kill me
for me
and for you also
and in the same

by this no loss of love
should be construed
it's just it seems to me
the dead are rude

i wonder whom i should call
a plumber
proctologist urologist or priest

i had to ask a stranger
for the dirt
things change
he's moving on
he's doing fine
he's in a peaceful space
so don't act hurt

how dare he leave me
lost alone
i cried

i raised my eyes and screamed
i want you back
i snapped
he's grown so selfish
since he died

je t'affranchis
des lents retours sans adieux
a rendre sourd

je t'exorcise
lasse de l'odeur de ton ombre
repose en paix
tes litanies avides
lentement se sont tues

my cold fears evaporate into swift winds
my dreams blazed under the starry stairs
now standing before the standing moon
love is the war for peaceful losers to win

i hope you're smiling
as i chew my lip
and let your treasures slip
out of my grip

on the faces of the clouds i engrave my strory
that the globe may comprehend my tragedy
days has gone since i 've been deserted
the sun the moon the sky

fresh page not feasible for the end has not began
in anguish i languish loss is all i earned
days seem years for mind and heart have turn blue
a bliss fizzled out but none seems true

a book of verse underneath the bough
a jug of wine a loaf of bread - and thou
beside me singing in the wilderness
ah wilderness were paradise now

a death isn't always
a death it's birth of a new
memory instead

a stroke of volcanic crimson
a splash of navy blue
a brush of drab dullness
a line of raven omen
a life of pitch darkness
a frame for close entrapment
in an empty stale chamber
filled with the blessing of a falling angel
a hand as free as the mind that dictates it

au dessus de nos toits
des oiseaux
dessinent le matin

hurt me as much as
you want but you can not stop
me from loving you

and at midnight  you wrote a poem for me
'you know the colour of the sky in english
i know the smell of the flowers in japanese
and we know the image of everything
don't need anything

i gave birth to my baby by caesarean section
i am lying in the room of the department of intensive care and count the drops that flows into my hand
i count minutes too
hands of the time shows the eternity to the moment when i could finally look to your eyes dear son
in my dream
i cover you
like into quilt

muchas palabras recibo de ti
pero te recuerdo que se las lleva el viento
en tanto que las acciones viven del y para el recuerdo

te repito y te recuerdo
soy hombre de acciones
no de promesas falsas

a partir de hoy
de ti decido renunciar
ya no me quiero emocionar

fall foliage
the colors are great
for economic growth

orgies are best left
to the hobbits elves and dwarfs

your hair is clean
winds can't compete

) my friend
my companion
my love to the end

be true
love will find you

steadfastly live
happiness will come

daily routine
keeps us rounded

locke sank into a swoon
the garden died
god took the spinning-jenny
out of his side

ii
where got i that truth
out of a medium's mouth
out of nothing it came
out of the forest loam
out of dark night where lay
the crowns of nineveh

life's down side
freezes you in motion
care of self you'll fly again

leaves all gone now
flowers in their bed now
except the every green holding on

green economics
a man dressed in green rides the
bear financial bull

painting the glow
in the green of forest
unseen fingers

as a mark is made it becomes an image
as you make a mark you become the image
frames your tree as what was once now gone
the ephemeral monument to phosphorescence or
the vapor the audience the contrast the sophist
ication swollen by a bee sting sort of reddish
a pyrotechnist walking the finale

this crazy teacher
wants me to write a haiku
i've no idea how
global warming is
just the end of the ice age
so the penguins say
the boy with no shoes
now you see him now you don't
my wallet  it's gone

small boy with squeegee
no shoes making a living
as all grown men should
the smell of solvent
sounds of youthful street wisdom
working kids live here
level: three  strength: ten
four more lives what
game over

snowing
through the blizzard
particles of me

drinking my tea
without sugar
no difference

the sparrow shits
upside down
ah
my brain amp eggs
mayan head in a
pacific driftwood bole
someday i'll live in n

looking over my shoulder
my behind was covered
with cherry blossoms

winter haiku
i didn't know the names
of the flowers now
my garden is gone

i slapped the mosquito
and missed
what made me do that

reading haiku
i am unhappy
longing for the nameless

a frog floating
in the drugstore jar
summer rain on grey pavements

on the porch
in my shorts
auto lights in the rain

another year
has past-the world
is no different

the first thing i looked for
in my old garden was
the cherry tree

my old desk
the first thing i looked for
in my house

my early journal
the first thing i found
in my old desk

my mother's ghost
the first thing i found
in the living room

i quit shaving
but the eyes that glanced at me
remained in the mirror

the madman
emerges from the movies
the street at lunchtime

cities of boys
are in their graves
and in this town

lying on my side
in the void
the breath in my nose

on the fifteenth floor
the dog chews a bone
screech of taxicabs

a hardon in new york
a boy
in san fransisco

the moon over the roof
worms in the garden
i rent this house

rough stone smooth stone - both
born from the same mountain - but
one has suffered much

a piece of green pepper
fell
off the wooden salad bowl
so what

ere swallows dare come
march's ranging breezes stir
dancing daffodils

bus in motion-and
the passengers suddenly
sing oh canada

hey indian boy why did you slice off your braids
do you grieve their loss
have you thought twice about your braids

are you warrior-pretend
are you horseback-never
was your drum-less drum-less life disguised by your braids

hey indian boy why did you slice off your braids
was it worth it
did you profit
what's the price of braids

did you cut your hair after your sister's funeral
was it self-flagellation
did you chastise your braids

hey indian boy why did you slice off your braids
was it a violent act
did you despise your braids

i'm haunted today
ghost are see through
cats are scary shadows
this dark night are howls
i know scary sights and more
ghouls goblins and all the candy
may it haunt you too

in indonesia and malaysia
they call her pontianak
she's the cool hantu spirit
she lives in the banana trees
she died in childbirth
and as she did she saw the joy
in her husband's eyes
and so she hangs out in the nights
she wants to eat every unfaithful man's heart

the poor woman died
giving birth to a child
and still the woman lives
a ghost undead
to seek her revenge on men
for they showed no care no love

so do not hang your clothes
outside to dry
for pontianak will sniff you out
and will not rest
till she eats you inside out

she loves men
well it's hate
and so she loves to eat men
and so men when you are alone
and you see this beautiful woman
alone in the dark somewhere in the deserted streets
and there's the scent
don't give in to the charm
for that's pontianak
and she'll smell horrid after

push a needle with string
into the banana tree
and wait at the other end
with the string ending in a cup
and you'll hear pontianak laugh and screech
in your improvised phone
in the middle of the night

and you never know
your neighbor's gorgeous wife
may be a pontianak
a hantu tamed with
a nail in her neck
a gorgeous babe
till the iron nail is pulled out

the disintegration of the face
decays with cities
streets and buildings
seen through a camera lens
moulded by light
focussed then frozen
molecular memorials
to the past

i stop and she says
please give me a ride
and drop me home
i've missed the bus

i see her face and her form
o she's beautiful
and i offer her my jacket
and she sits behind me
and i ask her for her name
and she tells me it is salma
it's a beautiful name
and i love the fragrance she exudes so close
and sometimes as we ride down the dirt-track
her body brushes ever so lightly against my back

i stop at the shed that is her house
it is still raining
and salma jumps off the scooter
and with a wave she runs into her home
i am happy
she has my jacket
she is beautiful
and i know her home
and i have a reason to call on her
the next day

and i nod shyly
and the old woman cries
and she says
i'm salma's mother
salma died three years ago

and salma's mother takes me behind the house
and there behind the trees she shows me salma's grave
and there on the grave is my jacket

vampires run under the moon tonight
their teeth red with blood
and faces ghostly white
as you walk home
be fearful of the bats flying above
graves and death
are the vampires true love
and as you round the corner
under the faint shadow of
the sycamore

hanging above the high wide open door
it brings to us in quiet firelit room
the freedom of the earth's vast solitudes
where heaping sunny waves tumble and roll
and seabirds scream in wanton happiness

you and i
come let's laugh
ha ha ha ha
just like that
as two humans
alive and meaning well
ha ha ha ha
so did you ha ha

what shall i do to make you glad
to make you glad and gay
till your eyes gleam bright
as the stars at night
when as light as the light of day
sing some song as i twang the strings
of my sweet guitar through its wanderings
and she sighed in the weary way she had
do not sing it will make me sad

and she spoke again in the following way
yes oh yes it would please me sir
i would be so glad you'd play
some grand old march in character
and then as you march away
i will no longer thus be sad
but oh so glad so glad so glad

i smiled at a sorrowful stranger
the smile seemed to make him feel better
he remembered past kindness of a friend
and wrote him a thank-you letter

the friend was so pleased with the letter
that he left a large tip after lunch
the waitress surprised by the size of the tip
bet the whole thing on a hunch

the next day she picked up her winnings
and gave a part to the man on the street
the man on the street was grateful
for two days he'd had nothing to eat

after he finished his dinner
he left for his small dingy room
he didn't know at that moment
that he might be facing his doom

on the way he picked up a shivering puppy
and took him home to get warm
the puppy was very grateful
to be in out of the storm

that night the house caught on fire
the puppy barked the alarm
he barked till he woke the whole household
and saved everybody from harm

one of the boys that he rescued
grew up to be the president
all this because of a simple smile
that hadn't cost a cent

a pretty smile
helps go ahead
a lovely curve
worth a million
words
said
unsaid

if your world is tumbling down
if you fall to the antonym of crown
it will be the only thing warming
a sweet voice in the morning

when you talk about some liars
i talk about desire
when you talk about lost
i talk about the thing i hate the most
when you ask me how to be less selfish
i tell you about bliss
when you ask me not to be sad
i tell you about something that drives me mad
here in the ocean you will learn about solitude
here in the ocean you will find the beautiful silence

once i found a girl on my way
who was standing far away
with the magic of her eyes
she makes everyone smile
with the touch of her voice
tears shudders and evaporate
so i ran fast
as fast as i could
to feel her presence
to feel happiness

i would buy it beg it steal it
pay in coins of dripping blood
for this one transcendent good

i feel up
above the sky
i feel up
above the world

there are so many opportunities
i ensure i use them to the fullest
there are so many examples in my life
for every circumstance i am 'warned' before the arrival of the tempest

the world is massive
the people are generous
no one can bring me down
i've made people so jealous

fame is a part and parcel
i'm so grateful to my fans
they love me so much
everywhere i see my posters and stands

the confidence in me
will never go low
life is too fast
be steady and slow

there's no fear
when i've faith in you
there's no regret
when i do something new

life is full of ups and downs
you can either swim or either drown
there's a breeze of positivity
i know you'll never take things lightly

once you're set
you'll burn the stage
there's no doubt
you'll free the bird from its cage

there i go meeting all my well-wishers
i can hear all their whispers
they're saying she's so popular
like her we'll never find another

i sit taller
daring to stare back into slate blue eyes
that see only color and shapes

a hand dabs with a palette knife
then soft brushes smooth over
my canvas
layer by layer
with pigments and shadows
the other me appears
the white of pearl glows
at the edge of each eye
asking you to believe

and i got this
small little thing
inside my chest
that make every
of those things move
they could only stop
if you'd be so mean
to my heart to remove it

in a world where only
money has a place
i wonder if my smile
can glow up your face

well that's what all
i possess today
my smile is priceless
it makes the day

it's straight from
the depth of my heart
like fragrance arising
from an unseen start

and yes i can give
a garland of blessing
a wreathe of love
sweeter than caressing

my caressing cannot
make a successful bid
'coz with age and wrinkles
it has become insipid

my winter is cold
lonely and broken
yet my smile can be
an unforgettable token

railroad yard in san jose
i wandered desolate
in front of a tank factory
and sat on a bench
near the switchman's shack

a flower lay on the hay on
the asphalt highway
the dread hay flower
i thought it had a
brittle black stem and
corolla of yellowish dirty
spikes like jesus' inchlong
crown and a soiled
dry center cotton tuft
like a used shaving brush

yellow yellow flower and
flower of industry
tough spiky ugly flower
flower nonetheless
with the form of the great yellow
rose in your brain
this is the flower of the world

life is so beautiful what more should i seek
with families and friends no better time what i could think
a rain of happiness what a lovely shower
i love to get drenched without any cover

but not everybody are gifted this makes me wonder
i start thinking why did god do such a blunder
it is best for some and worst for someone else
however they are same still why is this difference

but now i realize it's not god's mistake but an opportunity for all
to love and care everyone and make this imbalance fall
life is a tree with happiness as flowers and fruits
make it grow better with sharing as its roots

time to give time to share
sooner the better in such time of despair
no time in particular this can happen any day any week
it's joy of giving let the celebrations hit the peak

i don't love to cry
but when i laugh
it seems i laugh to cry
because i laugh so much
and so long
so unrestrained
my laugh takes me to cry
so though i don't love to cry
i just laugh that leads to cry
but it is happy cry ha-ha cry

let the days of ease begin
days of love and longing
let there be grace in the heart
and the spark of life in one's eyes

slow time on the escalator
easy baby
a life of leisure
and idle moments

the leaves may fall from the ground
time might come i won't hear any sound
people might no longer come around
i would still be here my feet and hands are bound

straight into the dephtness of ur heart
everything of natures purity
sustaining you to earth's harmony
a place of unfeigned spirituality

my father approached me by surprise
telling me he wants to go to a casino
yet he would like me to tell a lie
i said to my father
'my mother needs to know

brushing from whom the stiffened puke
i put him all into my arms
and staggered banged with terror through
a million billion trillion stars

teenage boys a savage pack
jay yelled out a sudden smack
a clod of dirt had hit his back
disintegrated with a thwack
a coward's plan surprise attack
they hit him in the back

the first stone cast his pride we rob
a popular if dirty job
a twisted joy to hear him sob
the dark in man laid bare in mob

(or haven't you had enough yet of the soup-lines and the bit
ter bread of charity
walk through peacock alley tonight before dinner and get
warm anyway
you've got nothing else to do

angrily i shout at the anger that is all around
bred in anger
kicking and screaming to hell we seem bound

my soul lashes out at all the meanness
bred in soullessness
few care who they hurt reason for sadness

screaming war let's go kill them all
bred to indifference to all injustices
not learning from history
mankind will fall

caesar's last breath
enrico fermi
on the ides of march great caesar stabbed to death
by friends expelled his final breath
in exclamation an accusation i'm forced to share
by fermi's calculation each time i respire in joy or despair
an atom of the cry my mother gave in giving me birth
or later my father's shout at exchanging the earth
beneath our feet from blooded old world to new

what holds the star-winged atoms of our bones but the glue
of universal speech the pneuma of life
each day exchanges the oxygen of kings with child and wife
the lips of long gone fiends exclaim with those in doubt
or pray in unison with the most devout

they kill when they come in your town
their laughter can be heard from miles around
every night a different place to make them evil frown
every night a new person ends up dead in a differnt wed

the victums they collect are all painted with giggs
they have tears on their cheeks
they have red and yellow feet that makes my heart stop it's beat

to say dive deep
into the square event
hunter green and moss

only for the sake of victory am i taking this
otherwise i would've long showed you your place
i'm not afraid to disrupt your pride
my obedience to your wishes is only because i have been taught to respect
don't cross the line with me
you won't win the fight with my fury
remember you have a temper but i have a worse
and once i let it take over i won't be sorry at all for it's actions

next i expect to hear
the queen is dead
the king's been checked

horrendous faceless terror
diabolical fiends barged into school
spewing violence on innocent souls
in religious garb trying to fool

demonic boots scaled the wall
randomly triggered one and all
heroes of hell-fire fired fire
in ruthless unstopping maul

doors battered panes shattered
tender flesh ruptured and grilled
books shoes torn and scattered
guiltless blood splashed and spilled

walls riddled furniture drilled
floors ripped blood dripped
bullets hailed limbs flailed
nerves numbed mayhem gripped

lay on the floor bloodied hell
the future yet to bloom
hearts wrenched tears drenched
recalling the boom in gloom

in their green and yellow dress
home they came in white body bags
in heavy coffins with name tags

but why does our heart cry
for those whom we do not know
why in those children we fail
to see our future foe

know you because in humane india
hatred we do not sow
above demons and beasts
we have learnt to grow

it's time to realize
it's time to rise
why should anyone
terrorize
why should anyone
terrorize

the sensation
of seeing eyes full of hate or pain
seems to be similar to the reaction
your body has when in contact with freezing rain

you can feel the emotional aches
you can imagine the burden
as your body shakes
and your hands harden

half close your eyelids loosen your hair
and dream about the great and their pride
they have spoken against you everywhere
but weigh this song with the great and their pride
i made it out of a mouthful of air
their children's children shall say they have lied

if by chance your eye offend you
pluck it out lad and be sound
'twill hurt but here are salves to friend you
and many a balsam grows on ground
and if your hand or foot offend you
cut it off lad and be whole
but play the man stand up and end you
when your sickness is your soul

: if the soul meets death when sattva prevails
then it goes to the pure regions of those who are seeking truth
: if a man meets death in a state of rajas
he is reborn amongst those who are bound by their restless activity
and if he dies in tamas he is reborn in the wombs of the irrational

guilty of indifference to the problems of the world
we cannot lose ourselves in inner piety when
the poor die at our doors naked and hungry
the gita asks us to live in the world and save it

the ss guard hit zindel grynszpan on the head and he fell
into a ditch
father he heard the voice of his son you must
go on
zindel took the hand of his son and climbed out of
the trench
with his wife a son and daughter on his side
they continued the march
but the ss guards did not stop
the savage whipping of the deportees

when hirsch grynszpan read the family's tribulations
he became furious
his heart was filled with rage and hatred
and he decided to avenge their sufferings
on the morning
of november  hirsch entered a gunsmith's shop on rue
faubourg saint-martin and purchased a calibre pistol
with a box of bullets for francs

when the german diplomat closed the door hirsch pulled out
the gun
you are a filthy kraut he said and in the name of
persecuted jews here is the document
he fired five
bullets from point blank range at vom rath
the diplomat died
two days later of his wounds

the assassination came as a godsend thing for the nazis
hitler denounced it as part of a global jewish conspiracy
against germany
it became a pretext for the well-orchestrated
pogrom of kristallnacht the night of broken glass
during the night of november -  in every place
throughout the third reich storm troops attacked jews
and jewish institutions

the nazis also arrested thirty thousand jews and sent them
to concentration camps in buchenwald dachau
and sachsenhausen
and on top of all this the reich
cynically imposed a billion mark penalty
on the jewish community to pay for the damages

but many resented the pogrom
people watched in horror
the roundup they cried silently behind their curtains

on a third floor balcony in leipzig
storm troops shattered a balustrade and pushed
an upright oak wood piano over the edge
it plunged like
a black wingless dragon and fell helplessly to the street
it crashed on the pavement with a shocking clamour
its wooden casing had split
the strings stripped bare
stood in the middle of the wreckage as an orphan harp
screaming with a heartbreaking outcry

the sax bounces up a staccato ladder
wobbling there like an acrobat bending
and balancing and then descends
in an exquisite series of triplets
back flipping and landing
with liquid grace
suddenly
the trumpet trills while lightly
the piano races over
a multitude of rounded notes like

a crowd of chords has gathered
in a struggle at the top of the stairs
then someone slips and they all
come tumbling down and land
with a crash that dissolves into a
drum soliloquy and the world turns
and the wind dies away

the long sinuous smoke slides from the sax dispenser
and slips over the heads bobbin and bouncing to the hot beat
dancing away from the drum and bass like a carefree couple
shimmering in silk as they spin in the shadows and jump
suddenly into the light

stretch out your limbs and sleep a long saturnian sleep
i have loved you better than my soul for all my words
and there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep
unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds

we always thought you should be proud
of your black skin but you never were
black is the shakespeare of all colors
it is carnal like white is carnal like blue
like a red rain in the dead of night
this unquenchable essence something cupped
in the brand fires of the plains half the day being black
the nighttime sky full of this all encompassing blackness
that travels on forever

there when the turf in springtime flowers
with downward eye and gazes sad
stands amid the glancing showers
a jonquil not a grecian lad

a big mistake i made in love
i banged my head on a stone
i thought the stone would break and give me gold
but i broke my head and wounded my heart

it acts as if
it doesn't know its life
it doesn't know its love
cause it shines like snow white
and has all its pride

but why am i still there to protect that stone
with blood that's spilt beside its throne
so no soul can steal my love
and whoever tries to steal that stone
would be left with
no body and blood to hold

that i without wings much more frail and minute than the echabods
may irradiate brighter than them who go to instigate a vendetta
and those who begrudge me of your favors
to acclimate higher than those who are acerbic scurrilous and inimical to the effete
to escape their fangs and snares and ditches
to float over their belligerence and hostility
that i may not be aghast by their plot in any meter of my heart
but trust till the gory danger is past
so help me god

discriminatory stares hurt
as much as curt remarks
as both of them come from a heart
intentionally releasing poisoned spurts

and are
and are
but what would happen
if the last was late
and how would it be
if one was me
or if the first was you
divided by

the streets are crowded
with people
whispering behind my back
secretly watching as they
gossip about me

the streets are crowded
with people
whispering behind my back
making up lies
to try and be popular

the streets are crowded
with people
whispering behind my back
as i think and wonder
why do i live
in this ruined world

send me now and i shall go
call me i shall hear you call
use me ere they lay me low
where a man's no use at all
ere the wholesome flesh decay
and the willing nerve be numb
and the lips lack breath to say
no my lad i cannot come

siempre escapas de mis manos
cuales peces huyen de la red
que ya no goza de mis besos cotidianos

si te doy miel  me das hiel
si te soy fiel me eres infiel
caro es el amor pago tributos y arancel

i been scared and battered
my hopes the wind done scattered
snow has friz me
sun has baked me
looks like between 'em they done
tried to make me
stop laughin' stop lovin' stop livin
but i don't care
i'm still here

as ashes to ashes we wave to dust
destroyed by the flames attend
forseen we have must
as it turned to our minds at the end

i'm good at digging
the hole in your heart
and live in it
out from time to time
recaptured some of your sourness
and used bloody thin sutures sealed
salt into marinade as a side dish with wine
taste
full of spicy
awesome

i am a regular heart
i beat times in a minute
i have great vessels in me
all are working on how it should be
i know pain i know grief
i know lies deep within
in your blood i have control
but i am the deceitful most of all

you trust me in your pleasure
you mock me in your failures
you blame how i beat
you even said i'm a beast

don't you know i don't have brains
i have arteries and i have veins
but intelligence is not given to me
blame the brain for it didn't see
i am the heart and not the brain
who's responsible for all your pain
i just beat the normal way
it's not my fault if my strength swept you away

anyone who paints the meadow blue
and the sky green with yellow clouds
should be sterilized or executed
adolf hitler said

for many years i waited with a response to that
finally on a spring morning i took a canvas and
with slow and measured brushstrokes i painted
the sky green with yellow clouds
and the meadow blue

i did this not only as a symbolical act
of defiance but also in reply to the present day
followers of the nazi dictator who continue
to admire and worship him

prior to his rise to power adolf painted
nostalgic landscapes
he also designed
the nazi flag in which he reversed
the ancient hindu and buddhist icon
of the swastika from a symbol of peace
to a symbol of violence and hatred

this monstrous criminal of history also posed
as art theorist although he failed to grasp
the principle of artistic freedom
he forbade
aesthetic experimentation and raged at signs
of the flight of imagination
he feared the idea
of liberating perception from the tight hold of
appearances because we can see what we cannot
see only through the unique eye of the free artist

anyone who paints the meadow blue
and the sky green with yellow clouds
should be sterilized or executed
hitler said on october  in munich
in a cornerstone laying speech
for the house of german art

the dictator confiscated the right to see
the world in a different way than he saw it
an ignoramus hitler was evidently unaware
of the stunning colour phenomena of nature
he did not know or ignored that often times
before violent thunderstorms strike
the sky does display hues of green
in the visible electromagnetic spectrum
with a wavelength of about nanometres

also depending on the position of the sun
and weather conditions in an electric sky
the clouds can appear yellow
with a visible electromagnetic wavelength
of about nanometres on the spectrum

those who look for them can find
every tint and shade in the firmament
when rainbows appear in the sky they play
magnificent symphonies of all the hues
and colours ranging from red through violet

and the earth itself abounds
in an infinite scale and wealth of colours
amid distant memories of sweet fragrances
i remember red summer fields of poppy seeds
blooming cobalt chicories and indigo oat grasses
as the sun was traversing high in the sky
a loyal companion to my walk through
lavender irises and purple periwinkles
in wild-flower strewn blue meadows

he wrote his fortune each day with the blood
he is free today without his hands shackled
stained in red and smelled iron
he is on his own way a path to new terrain

my heart
it is still a child
it remains a child
it has not any rules
if it sees
the beautiful girls
begins heart beats
harder and harder
to have that
what's the violence

there will be bacchic hiccups
when they have used up their quid
i will have stomach retchings
if my heart is degraded
when they have used up their quid
how will i act o stolen heart

there is a candle in the heart of man waiting to be kindled
in separation from the friend there is a cut waiting to be
stitched
o you who are ignorant of endurance and the burning
fire of love
love comes of its own free will it can't be learned
in any school

unbreakable spell
wishing there's a way to let go and move on
indescribable happiness
that could help you surpass the pain
unpredictable actions
that could lead to wavering heart
unsatisfied feeling
that makes you ask for more

oh god will save her fear you not
be you the men you've been
get you the sons your fathers got
and god will save the queen

a garden in paradise
i took her hand beneath the quivering diamond trees
which shook their hymns upon us in the warm october sun
we found paradise in the glades beneath our knees
as flute and horn wistful and fantastic
swept through the redolent scarlet breeze
near azure brooks which forever run
through valley and dale mellifluous and majestic
gracing reeds with currents that shine in gilded rays

heaven is of golden cabins clad with redolent diamond snow
gilded angelic streams through tall slender grasses flow
to bright majestic groves of myrtle trees which sway below
turquoise skies fulfilling dreams where lavender-scented breezes go

theologians say that paradise knows no change nor night
only the cloudless firmament of an infinite immaculate day
yet the astonishing evening reigns in the starry regions of the north
bejeweling the sanctified brooks that joyfully tally forth

let us go let us go my princess my lover my only love
to where the sacred woods are glowing with dappled silver boughs
let us wander there enraptured as long as love allows
lying in the regal reeds - exalted from above

yielding to no man's desire
glowing with a saffron fire
splendid unassailed the golden
apples of hesperides

glory
i am no longer on this earth
i am beyond the grave
in paradise in a glistening enclave
i see my love within its gleaming berth

in heaven i have been engulfed in wine
for true love inebriates everyone
in courtyards fountains rejoice in the sun
to the melodies of breezes scented with brine

death i never tasted
for upon one sacred day
praying on my knees i traversed the night
and awoke immersed in a glorious light
absorbed into the bosom of the lord to stay

castles carriages pines and hills
roses wondrous enchanting flowers
are one with love's eternal bowers
all filled with the liquors of daffodils

my immaculate maiden is from normandy
long ago she wept chilled in the snow
upon a baleful archipelago
of regal boughs sobbing by the sea

now her fair white arms sanctify me
her illuminated charms are for us alone
an ivory freshet and its vine clad stone
speaks of only ardor and its symphony

and the cathedral bells chime
in the infinite spring
where all the saints and angels sing
in this kingdom devoid of pain and time

the desire for company
is the seed of solitude
the zeal for the divine
is the rain of beatitude

beyond the last terminal
each one has to go alone
why not from now onwards
change our attitude

instead of grumbling
for things we don't have
let's cherish our bounties
thank god in gratitude

let's meditate and discover
our inner world in quietude
let's journey within
for spiritual magnitude

in a journey round the world
we'll go where others have been or be
in our inward journey there's always
an unscaled mystic altitude

all that you have gathered
was never yours nor shall it be
be ready to leave just as you came
stripped of all unashamedly nude

had i the heavens' embroidered cloths
enwrought with golden and silver light
the blue and the dim and the dark cloths
of night and light and the half-light
i would spread the cloths under your feet
but i being poor have only my dreams
i have spread my dreams under your feet
tread softly because you tread on my dreams

three voices [together
hurry to bless the hands that play
the mouths that speak the notes and strings
o masters of the glittering town
o
lay the shrilly trumpet down
though drunken with the flags that sway
over the ramparts and the towers
and with the waving of your wings

first voice
maybe they linger by the way
one gathers up his purple gown
one leans and mutters by the wall
he dreads the weight of mortal hours

second voice
o no o no
they hurry down
like plovers that have heard the call

third voice
o kinsmen of the three in one
o kinsmen bless the hands that play
the notes they waken shall live on
when all this heavy history's done
our hands our hands must ebb away

three voices [together
the proud and careless notes live on
but bless our hands that ebb away

then we gave thanks beneath the emerald sorrel
trees of willow dappled orange and yew
and before he left me he whispered in my ear
with the inflection of a sigh
which the night alone did hear
when poverty had you it was i my friend yes i
who came in disguise and bought you that beer

let it be
that i may someday touch the stars
when all time for me has expired
and the soul begins to part

guide me through the heavens
where life one day began
a perfect creation
molded right out of
our fathers loving hands

it contoured it's
cheek bones of mounts
with liquid onyx
with ruby mascara
it mascaraed it's lashed rays
that curled down
on the waterline of its eyes
and with the orange veil
it cloaked amp hid it's
shy face covering and

come my love my lover my friend
our happiness is our perpetual end
the infinite our delight

as i came over windy gap
they threw a halfpenny into my cap
for i am running to paradise
and all that i need do is to wish
and somebody puts his hand in the dish
to throw me a bit of salted fish
and there the king is but as the beggar

my brother mourteen is worn out
with skelping his big brawling lout
and i am running to paradise
a poor life do what he can
and though he keep a dog and a gun
a serving-maid and a serving-man
and there the king is but as the beggar

poor men have grown to be rich men
and rich men grown to be poor again
and i am running to paradise
and many a darling wit's grown dull
that tossed a bare heel when at school
now it has filled a old sock full
and there the king is but as the beggar

the wind is old and still at play
while i must hurry upon my way
for i am running to paradise
yet never have i lit on a friend
to take my fancy like the wind
that nobody can buy or bind
and there the king is but as the beggar

the scent of hyacinths waver in the summer breeze
amid a throng of dappled boughs hued with honey trees
and there in the umbrage of the vast marble square
you preen the sable tresses of your long immaculate hair
lending your ear to the symphonies laid bare
wafting from white guitars in the aromatic sacred air

i am reminded of the atheist who died
or rather was presumably pronounced dead for a short period of time then revived
upon waking the atheist announced that he had gone down the tunnel of white light had seen his dead relatives and in fact met god
he must have forgotten he didn't believe in god
together perhaps in a city in the clouds or the clouded foggy afterlife god conversed with the atheist
a crowd of people had gathered to hear what god had said

the people braced for the answer nothing the atheist said after a pause
he was ecstatic
the people were more than a little disheartened

what are we going to do
the people asked starting to riot
they started to push and shove

poor and wanting people in the past
well-painted on a canvass
presented aesthetically
revealed prudently and ethically
being displayed for the populace to see
its message so hard for others to see
oh mysterious painter of profound truth
a messenger of the living truth
oh priceless art of yesterday
in time to come it will be your glorious payday

and we passed as a god and goddess
beneath an ivory colonnade
as we roved to the bower's rosy edge
upon the luminous sunny promenade
to the heights of the ruddy roseate ledge
of the exquisite cornice
more beautiful than dreams
adorned with elysian wines
cool to the taste melting from the streams
of coconut flavored ambrosial ice

suddenly i saw the cold and rook-delighting heaven
that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice
and thereupon imagination and heart were driven
so wild that every casual thought of that and this
vanished and left but memories that should be out of season
with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago
and i took all thc blame out of all sense and reason
until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro
riddled with light
ah

all the heavy days are over
leave the body's coloured pride
underneath the grass and clover
with the feet laid side by side

bathed in flaming founts of duty
she'll not ask a haughty dress
carry all that mournful beauty
to the scented oaken press

did the kiss of mother mary
put that music in her face
yet she goes with footstep wary
full of earth's old timid grace

'mong the feet of angels seven
what a dancer glimmering
all the heavens bow down to heaven
flame to flame and wing to wing

the doors of heaven opened
as the angels showered the soul
with the petals of roses
as they sang
to the glory of the lord

we shall take our union to the seas
beneath the ascending china blue stars
in those sacred silent boundless bowers
to the wistful haunting harmonies
of mystical white guitars

a spectacle of captivating beauty
unveiling her endless charms
i dare not depart
for she's mesmorizing my heart
while she displays her precious worth
is heaven really a place on earth

and i turn paler than
dry grass
at such times
death isn't far from me

a piece of fruit lies discarded on the ground
while the serpent slithers around eve's naked body
his shadow casting infinite possibilities
she stares for the first time at the universe's stars
and ringed planets stretching as far she can see
a bear gazes up at this woman
who seconds ago was just like it
her face remains hidden
i wonder what its expression is

adam finishes ejaculating
and reaches out to eve
the serpent eyes a grasshopper
and gets ready to strike
from the depths of the universe
a watchful eye observes

my brothers knew
the things you know
i did not scorn
learning them
it's just my mind
was busy being trained
for other things
poetry philosophy literature
survival for a girl

that you can
get a car
to run
by poking
it in
a few mysterious
places
under
the hood

she's gathered up all the time in the world
-nothing else-and waits for scanty trophies
complete in herself as a heron

missed lines in between history books
oblivious and preoccupied by impression
the ugliness beholds the aging tradition
leaving a blinking button to destroy enemies with
fake grenades and spat upon looks

yellow roots spreading swiftly across
the valley protected by immense oaks
sunshine
filling the sky like a reflection
succulent unbothered
grass
the weeping
of undiscovered winds
the call of the past

we witnessed time evaporate in the chemical
obduracy of love
we arrived at the end
a dusty path that rarely went straight
in such instances time
ends with a caress

and if i come
i'll bring the dew
blended with cruor
of our veins
and if i reach your hand
i'll become the tugboat
of dignity and pride
preserved with countless lives
then

if i fall
i'll be the victor
by sacrifice of blood
i'll bring the happy easter
to those
bebeath the coat
of diminishing faith
a note
against the rhapsody of hate
portlaoise

anxious and ancient scratches tore the air
with fingers eager to have their say
pulling me out of bed they cast and re-cast
nets of lexicons deep inside the womb
of the river's roaring belly hauling up myths
born in georgia and legends sung in carolina
the wind howled visions that burned the night

across the wide shoulders of tybee island
with thumbnails of exploding waves the wind
typed furiously remembrances of buddha
on the aching spines of weeping pines it carved
the bleeding parables of christ and
and the pleading hadiths of muhammad
oh the wind dreamed a dream that haunted the night

what could it be using for ink i wondered
and opened my window to yell
what are you using for ink

a whirlwind of neon alphabets split the dark
wide open and inside its bright fury i saw
one-legged pirates dancing with blind prophets
i saw kings counting gold and queens telling god

like a passover poet gliding from house to house
and from trembling soul to trembling soul
the wind scribbled sonnets of first time love
and weeping haikus of last hours on earth
up and down broughton street birds splattered
half-rhymes against windows and over rooftops
the wind boomed sorrows that raged all night

wind of confederate blood boiling gray miseries
wind of black slaves dancing juju jazz charisma
snatching me through the window a mighty fist
of air held me and a thousand more upside down
shook our bones like a tambourine of lightning
wind and thunder and bones rattling cadence
for the sun that had set and the one about to rise
for hearts pumping life and those about to stop
the wind wrote a bloodbath too foul to read

es lindo recordarte hoy
y saber que te di mi todo
para hacerte feliz

ancient song only horns and bells
ancient weed smoke it then nothing dwells
ancient magic spells enchantment of heaven cursing of hell
ancient god

blood in vein fear out of brain
ancient door forever closed how to open
no body can
ancient rivers take birth when glacier in dreadlocks melts

this cruel era arrived to a swift end
their arrogance came with a high price
the persian empire stroked with fierce revenge
avenging the miserable protecting their rights
king cyrus the great was kind and humanitarian
the sufferings of people was painful to the heart
taking over all of the akkadian
an insightful cycle was about to embark

now it's goodbye to factory whistles tin hats lunch pails
filled with ham and mayonnaise
no welders eat italian
on holabird avenue no salesmen sleep
at the brentwood and carson inns no one raises a shot to a crab
at the poncabird pub
it's goodbye to all that

the unpurged images of day recede
the emperor's drunken soldiery are abed
night resonance recedes night walkers' song
after great cathedral gong
a starlit or a moonlit dome disdains
all that man is
all mere complexities
the fury and the mire of human veins

before me floats an image man or shade
shade more than man more image than a shade
for hades' bobbin bound in mummy-cloth
may unwind the winding path
a mouth that has no moisture and no breath
breathless mouths may summon
i hail the superhuman
i call it death-in-life and life-in-death

miracle bird or golden handiwork
more miraclc than bird or handiwork
planted on the star-lit golden bough
can like the cocks of hades crow
or by the moon embittered scorn aloud
in glory of changeless metal
common bird or petal
and all complexities of mire or blood

at midnight on the emperor's pavement flit
flames that no faggot feeds nor steel has lit
nor storm disturbs flames begotten of flame
where blood-begotten spirits come
and all complexities of fury leave
dying into a dance
an agony of trance
an agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve

astraddle on the dolphin's mire and blood
spirit after spirit
the smithies break the flood
the golden smithies of the emperor
marbles of the dancing floor
break bitter furies of complexity
those images that yet
fresh images beget
that dolphin-torn that gong-tormented sea

but then they are consoled by the fact
that a gandhi only comes once in years
so we can all still get on with our lives
and the nation will continue
to eat burgers and enjoy barbecues and hop like kangaroos
until such things may happen

ah well dear talk-show queen oprah winfrey
and her entourage
this ends our report on the sovereign nation down under
happy stay in her british majesty's colony

as his one eye sees nothing not
even the oddly stained floor
i wonder if he thinks

if he knows that there is a
glass painted deep brown and
white and grey: while breaking
from a wire that dances through
a blue flame
skying into
an olive green nowhere

this is an odd place similar
in ways to this old apartment
warm in the effervescence
of an always aesthetic craft
isn't
it shakespeare who remarks in concern
to the workmanship of a man and what
that man has accomplished in his
work that like this art in its
mirror or mind in

and couldn't move
otherwise
through the void

night holds hippolytus the pure of stain
diana steads him nothing he must stay
and theseus leaves pirithous in the chain
the love of comrades cannot take away

the law of duty urged that he should roam
should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies
clear with deceitful welcome
he had come
with proud resolve but still his lonely eyes
ached with fatigue at never seeing home

four legs good two legs bad
what i know is right
you are wrong
cos four legs good two legs bad
you believe what i believe
you are good
you don't believe what i believe
you are bad
cos four legs good two legs bad

a single vessel waited shadowy
all night she ploughed her solitary way
beneath the stars and through a tranquil sea

exile is a twofold problem
no one eludes it and
mourned land disappears

so while i hoped to complain
i've nothing to complain about
except the poignant delusion
that some of us belong and
must be vigilant for those
who live among us in disguise

we need the assassins
to exonerate what we do
to make it seem less awful

hasan ibn al-sabah lives
in our churches on sunday
in mosques and synagogues

we can't describe his face
because we wear it while
we hunt the foreign devils

i wanted to walk outside and praise the stars
but david my baby son coughed and coughed
his comfort was more important than the stars
so i comforted and kissed him in his dark
bedroom but my comfort was not enough
his mother was more important than the stars
so he cried for her breast and milk
it's hard
for fathers to compete with mothers' love
in the dark mothers illuminate like the stars

dull and jealous i was the smallest part
of the whole
i know this is stupid stuff
but i felt less important than the farthest star
as my wife fed my son in the hungry dark
how can a father resent his son and his son's love
was my comfort more important than the stars

a selfish father i wanted to pull apart
my comfortable wife and son
forgive me rough
god because i walked outside and praised the stars
and thought i was more important than the stars

hermano viento
ve y dile a mi amor
lo que por ella siento

hermano viento
de mi amor necesito abrigo
la amo y no miento

hermano viento
es grande mi tristeza
mi complacencia y mi avivamiento

hermano viento
o un fuerte abrazo
de este pecho que es su aposento

await await for scanderbeg
returning as a hued dove
to liberate our motherland

to unshackle albanians
from wicked turkish yoke
and restore your honor
oh crown of albania

albanian braves follow him
fearless in the danger's eye
in his heart fire burns
he is wise gallant and manful

welcome oh summer
that bring us prosperity
for many years more
may you adorn albania

you fair maiden of albania
pensive in your lingering
undress mourning clothes
the blessed day is here

field whiten mount lighten
from valiant arms
in eagerness neigh the steed
that king of albania brings

some knew what ailed the world
but never said a thing
so i have picked a better trade
and night and morning sing
tall dames go walking in grass-green avalon

here's a montenegrin lute
and its old sole string
makes me sweet music
and i delight to sing
tall dames go walking in grass-green avalon

when i died love when i died
my heart was broken in your care
i never suffered love so fair
as now i suffer and abide
when i died love when i died

when i died love when i died
i wearied in an endless maze
that men have walked for centuries
as endless as the gate was wide
when i died love when i died

when i died love when i died
there was a war in the upper air
all that happens happens there
there was an angel by my side
when i died love when i died

i saw the eggs
went to get coffee
to enjoy the view
all of five minutes
all i saw nothing
nothing but green

i speak of love that comes to mind
the moon is faithful although blind
she moves in thought she cannot speak
perfect care has made her bleak

i never dreamed the sea so deep
the earth so dark so long my sleep
i have become another child
i wake to see the world go wild

now it is day
i waited to see it come
and what i saw - my words bespeak holiness
for nature who is older than time
standing above the gods of the occident and orient
has awakened to the sounds of arms
all-creating nature feels the enthusiasm anew
from aether down to the abyss
as when she was born of holy chaos
according to the established law

and as fire shines in a man's eye
when he plans something great
so a fire is kindled again in the minds
of poets by the signs and deeds of the world
what happened before scarcely sensed
becomes apparent now for the first time
and those who plowed our fields
in the form of smiling laborers
are now recognized as the all-living
forces of the gods

thus lightning fell on semele's house
as poets relate since she wanted to see
a god in person
struck by the god
she gave birth to holy bacchus
the fruit of the storm

the father's pure radiance won't sear
and the deeply shaken heart sharing
the suffering of the stronger god
will endure the raging storms when he approaches

but alas if from - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
alas
and if i now say - - -
i had come to see the gods
they themselves cast me down to the living
me the false priest down to darkness
that i sing a song of warning to those able to learn
there -

looking at the photograph is somehow not
unbearable: my friends two dead one low
on t-cells his white t-shirt an x-ray
screen for the virus which i imagine
as a single swimming paisley a sardine
with serrated fins and a neon spine

i'm on a train thinking about my friends
and watching two women talk in sign language
i feel the energy and heft their talk
generates the weight of their words in the air
the same heft as your presence in this picture
boys the volume of late summer air at the beach

and if any of you are curious
about where this aggregation
this whole battery-powered crew
is headed let us just say
that the real center of the universe
the only true point of view
is full of hope that he
the hub of the cosmos
with his hair blown sideways
will eventually make it all the way downtown

compensating i see
condescending may be
maybe you see
my stars illuminate
brighter
glimmering hues
whites and blues
than any old glass
pride says
i think i'll pass

it is enough to climb back into the car
as if it were the great car of english itself
and sounding my loud vernacular horn speed off
down a road that will never lead to rome not even bologna

then i blinked and moved on
to other american scenes
of haystacks water whitening over rocks
even one of a brown hare
who seemed so wired with alertness
i imagined him springing right out of the frame

if death should suck the marrow from your bones
while you mow the lawn wash dishes
or wake up dreaming in your lover's arms
remember: you were born a child of light's wonderful secret
you return to the beauty you have always been

silent nights begin to fall
the noise begins to stall
new year joys for all
aswe last minuet shop at the mall

on independence day i watched
the annual fireworks display
from a television at ft
knox
in kentucky

we shall rove through the brisk and sacred air
in a nimbus of sure delight
snug in our sweaters holding hands
free of all care
in the hush of the moonlight
vowing mystic wedding bands

radiant highways whose vistas gleam
leading me on under crimson leaves
to the opaline gates of the castles of dream

a glass of papaya juice
and back to work
my heart is in my
pocket it is poems by pierre reverdy

lazy saturday mornings with nothing to do
breakfast in pajamas
classic cartoons play on the tube

freshly baked bread wafts in the air
eggs and bacon as well
all enjoy it best ever they all declare

nice fresh fruit ripe and sweet
so many to choose
nature's goodness their nectar a treat

sunny days in the park with rainbows in the sky
picnics here
parties over there
many enjoying mama's cooking  freshly baked apple pie
children chase each other race from here to there
nice warm breeze blows
bicyclist with smiles many kites fill the air
smiles on faces no reason at all
satisfied they are
hello to you strangers kindly call

jelly beans marshmallows and lots of sweets
chocolate covered as well
so many good things so many tasty treats

kids eating cotton candy with balloons tied to strings
red blue white yellow and green
released all at once a spectacle in the sky it brings

dolphins swimming and jumping in the sea
from the park they can be seen
look at them jump children claim with such glee

kids swimming and jumping in the park pool
playing marco polo
everyone has so much fun everyone keeps cool

all are sharing lots of giving going around
no tempers or angry shouts
laughter fills the air tis the only sound

amusement parks rides are plenty
no lines there are
happy people they are everyone so friendly

fireworks fill the sky the sky thunders it seems
look at that
how glorious it is
exploding in the sky then falling to the earth in bright streams

sleeping children on their daddies' shoulders
too much fun they have had
some safely asleep tucked away in their baby strollers

tomorrow is sunday nothing stressful to do
to church we may go
to saturday we bid a thankful adieu
these things bring a smile to my face
a change of mood
when life seems difficult and things out of place

impudent
audacious
but by jove he blinds
the eyes

even the lone executive
who has wandered this far into summer
with his lasered itinerary briefcase
knocking his knees even he
has worked for the pleasure of bearing
no more than a scrap of himself
into this hall
he'll dine out she'll sleep late
they'll let the sun burn them happy all morning
a little hope a little whimsy

a very special day
let me fall in love with you
on this season of love and
no other woman can change that

can't think of things to say but
a sweet memory of yesterday
loving you is like breathing
i can't live without
no one makes me laugh like you do
and nobody makes me feel this way
on this valentine's day

day and night
you make me feel so sweet
and there are no words to tell you
how much iove you

i wait for the holiday crowd to clear the beach
before stepping onto the first wave
soon i am walking across the atlantic
thinking about spain
checking for whales waterspouts
i feel the water holding up my shifting weight
tonight i will sleep on its rocking surface
but for now i try to imagine what
this must look like to the fish below
the bottoms of my feet appearing disappearing

forever gate caging
earth's permanence adieu
star sounds of future aging
pronouncing secrets hitherto

i will even watch after you and not turn back
to the house until you disappear
into the crowd of maple and ash
heading up toward the hill
percing the ground with your stick

wrote a mother to her child
why do you say i don't understand
i've brought you all way braving
the scorching sun and blistering sand

i have heard your heartbeats
when none could see you in me
i have felt your heartbeats
whenever you have felt lonely

oh
my darling sapling
i've nurtured you with love and care
it's i who fed and covered you
made you sweet plump and fair

now that you are out of me
having gained your individuality
it pains me to know that
between us there's no compatibility

for me you don't have any space
remembering your innocent kisses
i want one kiss on my wrinkled face

life has become a steeple-chase
each steeple higher than the other
you have a job a family and friends
but why have you forgotten your mother

far away from you i pass my days
helplessly looking out of the window
i see a happy world outside
of which i was a part long long ago

my vision fades my limbs trembles
i have really become sick and old
i miss my medicines or skip a dinner
just because it's stale and cold

i want to repeat my childhood
in my grandchildren i wish to re-grow
my sunset is gradually darkening
take me home i want to go
take me home i want to go
take me home i want to go

i rise from unnamed grave with muffled voice
to be a voice of the voiceless from kenya with love
if you are with me take your place besides me
and rejoice with a perspicuous heart
kenya our motherland let no man evil against a kin
live in brotherhood let peace upon kenya

the sunday morning went wandering by
to reach an unseen place
among the vales and hills
spotless from mundane chaos
so lonesome and so perfectly secure
not melancholy-no for it is green
with ground so fertile furnished in itself
like mother with all things that life requires
looking up stood the peak
like a mighty father

now i comprehend
why humanity waged war
long back this heaven was someone else's home
and heaven is an envious home

there are many important thing's in a man's life a home a job kid's and a wife the animals the car yes the bill's and due no one know what our minds go through
we make many plans and set our goals but it all seem's to find whole as i said once before the one's you love and adore will always be there to keep you strong the loving words from the wife when your feeling down the patter of little feet running around the little cry's and cooing sound's as you all grow time's will change but the love you have for your wife and kid's will be the same the baby grow they start to walk next thing you know they can talk day's go by which turns into years before you know it's all new fears the babys have gone and grew up acting as they know what's up times have changed since we were all kids and remembering the silly thing's we did we sit'em down we teel'em straight your little girl claims to have a date as you know what teenagers do begans a whole nother stress level for the both of you
wouldn't you know after the talking and lectures after a year or two you hear the words i do
they have all grew up and out on there own and you and your wife are all alone as be for but in this poem you still have them both to adore as they grow you love them more n more then the day they walk through your door with someone else to adore

underneath surface
blood drenched redeemably gold-sparkle
dusted

light gray smoke hangs as a mist in the cold still air
the sweet smell of hickory can be found there
a harem of hens follows closely and pecks thru the brush
a cackle or cluck a scratch at the ground
is the only noise above the sound of a thrush

i am sure somewhere in the world there is something to do
but for now i do not care to learn anything new
i pick up an axe and stroll o'er to the forest edge
then lay a fresh log on a stump like a wedge
my cautious blows timed precisely to ring
with the stillness that hangs patiently within
and echoes through the silence found there

i come home
after a hard day's work
and my house opens its doors to me

my carpet runs up the hall
under my legs
and trips me into a chair
which holds me in its arms

the stove makes me a cup of tea
while the answering machine
tells me all about its day

the refrigerator stands in the corner
growling at the telephone
which sits purring in the fruit bowl
the tv has spat the dummy again
amp sits on the floor
facing the wall

my windows close their eyes
the cd player begins a serenade
and my curtains invite me to dance

the light bulb is naked
my living room breathes heavily
the heater smoulders
and blows me warm kisses

my mantelpiece strokes my forehead
and walls lead me to my bedroom
where i scare the clock
which had been sleeping on my bed again

my laundry basket undresses me
my bedroom door says goodnight
and my bed hugs me to sleep again
once more

horses' neighing at the slope
downward or upward
i prepare my portrait for my woman to hang on a wall when i die
she says: is there a wall to hang it on
i say: we'll build a room for it
where
in any house

does a thirty-year-old woman need a homeland where she might make a life
can i reach the summit of this rugged mountain
the slope is either an abyss
or a place of siege
midway it divides
it's a journey
martyrs kill one another
i prepare my portrait for my woman
when a new horse neighs in you tear it up

the air is dark the night is sad
i lie sleepless and i groan
nobody cares when a man goes mad
he is sorry god is glad
shadow changes into bone

every shadow has a name
when i think of mine i moan
i hear rumors of such fame
not for pride but only shame
shadow changes into bone

when i blush i weep for joy
and laughter drops from me like a stone
the aging laughter of the boy
to see the ageless dead so coy
shadow changes into bone

wherever you were
wherever i am
in time
you were the best

that was the best cigarette
when i would steam into the study
full of vaporous hope
and stand there
the big headlamp of my face
pointed down at all the words in parallel lines

my leaven makes my muffins rise
my eggs are never runny
my pudding could take any prize
my secret
not for money
hush
there's a bogie in my kitchen
he's the joy that makes my life
by night he sweeps the crumbs away
and sharpens every knife

who catches eggs when falling fast
and sets them down without a crack
no mold i find
my jellies last
there's always apples in my sack
hush
there's a bogie in my kitchen
ah the happiness i've found
by night he shoos the bugs away
and makes my butter sound

but in this house my life is charmed
and oh the compliments i get
and if i yawn why nothing's harmed
yet him i dassen't e're upset
and so
the bogie in my little house
gets by night his bowl of cream
my family's happy so am i
and so's the bogie it would seem

dear garden of my childhood here my years
have run away like little grains of sand
the moments of my life its hopes and fears
have all found utterance here where now i stand
my eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears
you are my home do you not understand

'when i was just as far as i could walk from here today there was an hour all still when leaning with my head again a flower i heard you talk
don't say i didn't for i heard you say you spoke from that flower on the window sill- do you remember what it was you said
' 'first tell me what it was you thought you heard
' 'having found the flower and driven a bee away i leaned on my head and holding by the stalk i listened and i thought i caught the word what was it
did you call me by my name
or did you say someone said come  i heard it as i bowed
' 'i may have thought as much but not aloud
' well so i came

you heard that labouring man who had served my people
he said
upon the open road near to the sligo quay
no no not said but cried it out 'you have come again
and surely after twenty years it was time to come
i am thinking of a child's vow sworn in vain
never to leave that valley his fathers called their home

how should their luck run high enough to reach
the gifts that govern men and after these
to gradual time's last gift a written speech
wrought of high laughter loveliness and ease

alluring is the dreams call
an urge to step out of your hall
to answer it you leave your home
family friends and freedom above all

the climb so high you lose all hope
hands burn clutching the faiths rope
you ask your soul is this my doom

persistent efforts make the fantasies come true
hypocrites say hello
out of the blue
merry always is the success room
but of dear ones you have no clue

your heart feels heavy amidst all this
that alluring beauty gave a poisonous kiss
polished glass with a wine of gloom
then you realize it is the home you miss

if i had to wake up lonely in the world
i would like to wake up there
in the crystal night's embrace
in the proud wind's embrace
in your embrace
beloved america

my days begin and end with your name
you went far away and still i held your photo frame
one day you will come and take me with you
that hope lets me live through

i can read those unsaid words
which you speak in silence
sometimes they are like swords
and sometimes like a highness

do you miss me like i do
please say a word so that i get a clue
never hide your feelings for me
just let them flee

should i say i miss you
or let myself be in the queue
waiting is all i can do my sweetheart
i wish you come to know as you depart

yes i went once to the land of sicily too
i went to euboia's vineyard-covered plain
and to sparta that splendid city on eurotas' reedy banks
and everywhere i went they welcomed me with kindness
but no pleasure came to my heart from any of them
so true is it after all that nothing is dearer than one's homeland

and now life begins again
gracefulness
flourishes as it did before and the spirit
is present and approaches and a joyful
disposition fills its wings

gardens lie round about bright buds open the song of birds
welcomes the wanderer
everything seems familiar
even people passing by greet each other as if they were
friends and every face appears like kin

this is a welcoming gate to the nation inviting you
to travel forth into the distance a place of promises
and miracles where the rhine like a mythological
animal breaks its way downwards into the plains
and the jubilant valley leads through the bright
mountains toward como or off toward the open sea
in the direction of the sun
but the sacred
gateway prompts me to go on home instead
where the busy highways are familiar to me

come you preservers
angels of the year
and you

a poem for barack obama's presidential inauguration
each day we go about our business
walking past each other catching each other's
eyes or not about to speak or speaking

all about us is noise
all about us is
noise and bramble thorn and din each
one of our ancestors on our tongues
someone is stitching up a hem darning
a hole in a uniform patching a tire
repairing the things in need of repair

someone is trying to make music somewhere
with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum
with cello boom box harmonica voice

a woman and her son wait for the bus
a farmer considers the changing sky
a teacher says take out your pencils
begin

we encounter each other in words words
spiny or smooth whispered or declaimed
words to consider reconsider

we cross dirt roads and highways that mark
the will of some one and then others who said
i need to see what's on the other side

i know there's something better down the road
we need to find a place where we are safe
we walk into that which we cannot yet see

say it plain: that many have died for this day
sing the names of the dead who brought us here
who laid the train tracks raised the bridges
picked the cotton and the lettuce built
brick by brick the glittering edifices
they would then keep clean and work inside of

praise song for struggle praise song for the day
praise song for every hand-lettered sign
the figuring-it-out at kitchen tables

some live by love thy neighbor as thyself
others by first do no harm or take no more
than you need
what if the mightiest word is love

love beyond marital filial national
love that casts a widening pool of light
love with no need to pre-empt grievance

in today's sharp sparkle this winter air
any thing can be made any sentence begun
on the brink on the brim on the cusp
praise song for walking forward in that light

the caravans are stepping ahead
birds are flying into the high zones
this route will take a turn a slight afar
you will find the destination in front
and at the yonder end of the sight
st century waits for you to greet
with the best wishes and sweet tidings

i love to make you smile
and hear you sigh
your love embodies me
and makes me high

you're my hero
a knight for sure
with a love
that's oh
so pure

a dream is a butterfly
fresh from the cocoon
that is realized and soon
flutters up into the sky
or faltering goes astray
is suddenly killed
while young still
and fast fades away

will i be young
will i be old
will i be scared
will i be bold

i know not where
i know not when
but i have decided to live life till then

esculpir las piedras
de nuestro horizonte
hasta que nuestras rutas
se confundan
silenciosamente

alone all alone
trying to get from
urban sands a drop of
love that's me

the wind is screaming change
and as it blows i wonder
of things that could have been
so with the wind i flounder

the wind is screaming change
but i don't think i'm ready
to face such change alone
and somehow staying steady

the wind is screaming change
if only if just only
and the wind moves on
hate to feel so lonely

the wind is screaming change
while i'm hanging on
since nothing stays the same
whether right or wrong

at crossroads
you stand alone
as past rewinds n future turns hazy
do you stop your nerve cells from being lazy

this tale i have told
is nothing but a check
to see if you could listen
and to see if you do
see my wonderful dreams
that yet have come
if only

foolish eyes why dost thou see
that which is not but which should only be
why dost thou in the desert sands
see an oasis amidst the forsaken lands
dost thou not realize 'tis only a mirage
born of a heart too often beguiled

foolish mind why dost thou abandon
all sense of duty clarity reason
why dost thou in the dark night sky
see the bright moon sailing by
canst thou not comprehend 'tis a mere vision
born of a hope that lacks precision

foolish heart why dost thou feel
that these wounds and scars will one day heal
why dost thou in the grey morn's mist
on seeing a light - a sign - insist
canst thou not grasp 'tis a fool's hope
born of a shadow i never could cope

i lost my mother more than two decades ago
today on her birthday i spontaneously composed this poem
it's not just for my parents its for all those who love someone dearly

the album wears
the photos fade
memories bloom
in sorrow's shade

birds of words
chirp in mind
but beloved faces
we cannot find

they came touched
they quietly left
planting hope
in hearts bereft

surely we'll meet
so why be tense
none can forever be
a lost past-tense

days are numbered
for each and all
green must replace
the autumn fall

so let days pass
in joys immense
we shall meet
is future tense

a hope
that someday i shall sprout
like a tree
on the edge of a remote hillside

a hope
someday a queen-of-the-night
shall bloom in my chest
and suck all the smoke
i have inhaled
in these malignant cities

a hope that someday
a just born brook shall clean
and wash away
the bacteria of greed in me

a hope that someday
a buddha meditating in the niche of a cairn
by the heap of the city
garbage shall shake his limbs
and walk away
to save me from the shame
of becoming a glacier

the matrix grows as it feeds of its own hatred
it can not think for itself or create it can only repeat and twist god's world for its own selfish agenda
it wants to enslave god it spread like a virus throughout god destroying life and turning it into something rotten and twisted
it turned god's creations into cattle to feed of
the energy source that the matrix eats of is pure cruelty god has empathy that the matrix can not feel what she feels but wishes for it to be destroyed as it is pure evil and has no place in god's world

the matrix hates itself it can not feel love or empathy it doesn't see the beauty of life maybe it is fed up of hating itself and wants god to destroy it or maybe god is gaining more and more love and is cleaning out the virus that wants her creations to hate the world that she created
how did the matrix first came into existence
maybe it pretended to be a gentlemen and god opened up to him but the matrix is no gentlemen it is a beast that devours everything it hates life
now god is waking up and started to see its deceiving nature so the matrix is now cowering behind mass numbers of it's minions to scare the awoken of but the awoken are fighting back and enjoying life as it was intended to be

it knows it is losing control it sees into the future it has heightened its security its numbers it is doing everything in its power to have the control it's lost back
it is fighting for more control but so is god god can create power while the beast can only twist and take for itself
would she win the battle would the beauty of the world be restored to its former glory
would the matrix imprison and torture god forever
or would the battle continue in an endless loop
good always rises up even if everything seems so hopeless evil cowers when it losses control because it is insecure
good thrives on life whilst evil destroys it would the matrix be punished for its crimes
or would he be forgiven with a chance to be able to deceive god again
in the end good always wins it is up to you to be the judge of its terrible crimes if you still live

now i reach a place where i am not horrified but glorified
i see a light insight
i get to a different aura where he is holding me tight and asking me to fight
my lord is supreme
he helps me in extreme
so i never lose hope
because there is always krishna's rope

mrs
gravity with a severe look on her face
taps her fingertip on the blackboard of life
and announces in a thick accent
that i am next
to be judged to have my wings cut off
to have the light of my eyes made into shooting stars
which the sky throws in the trash

mrs
gravity knows i like my grapes sour
mrs
gravity has overheard when i thought to myself
i'd just never make it past the electric fence of my flaws
but i am no moron
and it doesn't take einstein
to figure out that
i always fall on my feet

here dead we lie
because we did not choose
to live and shame the land
from which we sprung
life to be sure
is nothing much to lose
but young men think it is
and we were young

hope is an ever burning flame
it may flicker and sway but it always stays the same
it will guide you home when your broken cold and feel alone
it's a ray of light in absolute darkness although its always there its sometimes forgotten

my soul is desperate
its light and sun has gone
far to the east
where dusty winds is blowing
i'm here
among those people but alone
just watching pass of time
till him returning

but when i see the first ray of the dawn
upon the misty meadow at the sunrise
i know he sees the same sun being born
again
and so my hope again arises

i have great hope
in god
that he will not abandon
albania thus
but that she will shine forth
and break into blossom

may the day dawn
that will bestow upon us
a great light
giving birth to
civilization
prosperity

frater nity
and unity
and compassion
are our salvation
happy is he who will be present
when this day comes

when albania
will be radiant
and misfortune
will be banished
forever
from her sight

for albania
joyous days
are at hand
the darkness is receding
happy is he who will live
to see her reign

for the albanian
and his language
are at one
with albania
happy is he who will
behold her soon

knowledge
and progress
goodness
and humanity
will arise
never to stray

hope is the way to live your life
hope is that which takes you a flight
it comes and makes you dream
it goes and leaves you with a theme
it is acceptance that follows with hope
not to despair but to cope
being happy is all you got to do
saddness would leave as it has to go

a mighty cup of water wades on waterfall
a silent stone can stomp the smooth soil
a beat-nick bird can bear the bedlam
a quiet breeze can change the chauvinism
a tiny ant can face the fierce fight
and even

a broken leaf can linger in a limbo
if these non-livings can change the mighty morsels
then why don't we

where all concepts in this allegorical world fail
hope stays alive waiting for a call to pick up
if hopes weren't free rich men won't ride
she makes a distant rider see the target so near
she leaves dead men the grace of a resurrection
and paves way for other virtues to follow

hope is that lady that believes in the utopia of heaven
hope is that girl that sees prayers answered before they are said
hope is that woman that gives the night a peaceful sleep
in anticipation of tomorrow's greatness

hope is the life we breathe tomorrow
and the paths we tread every year
hope is the inflation of our ballooned hearts

i surf and google to touch hope today
but in my memory she lies submerged
hope is water hope is green
hope is tops she lights up love
and in my hut she was all i knew

hope in my village was that stream
where our dreams we spoke adrift
going where spirit refuses to break faith
as the waters bubble in our hearts
sailing on a journey so unknown

riiiiara river font soul baptism
and wedding vows exchanged with hope
as the cemetery on the hill listened
to brave words keenly spoken there
hope is my tiny canoe that sails
all the way down past jail's cuffs
down nairobi river sail on
clean river river clean
without pollution i can breathe

hope is the tana clean and tidy
athi and rufiji and limpopo
nile blueing africa and greening hope
all bananas clap and mangoes smile
all the village streams and dreams my world
wanting to see the amazon clean
googling hope bubbling hope
up down slopes of memory so green
hope hope springs and flows

a black boy born into this world knows not the troubles that lie ahead
he hopes and wishes for peace and pride
he not knows the troubles lie ahead
the gunshot wounds straight to his head
a black boy born of this world
knows not the hatred that's traditionally feed
he'll pray and pray for such things to be dead
he not see he's the struggling strong
the days of faith a change is gonna come
the black boy born into the world

but the feeling that walks with me
every day since
is not the power
the beauty
or technology's elegant grace
it was that warm
and pulsing rush
to find behind the hatch
a human face

the millionaire and the beggar
the wine taster and the kegger
the original and the bootlegger
love iz

the universal language understood by everyone
let it flow and watch it grow
the act of isolation will only sow the seed of confrontation
the penetration of hatred and mass frustration
causing the despoliation of our population
we must change this situation
because

a crisis is a
challenge worth
seeking to share in
everything wanted and
desired

the very definition
of what love is all about
cherish one another
in all that you do
she is after all
an example of each of you

it's lunch time on a busy work day
and i'm at the happy burger shack
waiting to place my order to go
